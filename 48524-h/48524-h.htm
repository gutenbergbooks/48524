<p class="chaptitle">THE HUT BY THE BAYOU.</p>


<p>"Lisden, vonce, you fellers! I t'ink I hear someding."</p>

<p>Carl Pretzel turned back from the forward rail of the
<i>Hawk</i>, gave his chums, Motor Matt and Dick Ferral,
a warning look, and then leaned out over the side of the
air ship, his eyes on the earth below.</p>

<p>The <i>Hawk</i> was sweeping over the tongue of land between
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Borgne, bound for
New Orleans by way of the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<p>Night was coming on, and the boys in the air ship had
been looking anxiously for a place in which to effect a
landing. Interminable stretches of cypress and live oak
covered the low ground beneath them, and there did not
seem to be a gap anywhere in the dense growth.</p>

<p>"You must have bells in your ears, mate," said Dick,
in response to Carl's announcement that he had heard
"something." "Dowse me if I heard any noise."</p>

<p>"Listen, pards, both of you," called Matt from his
seat among the levers. "If you can hear a voice, down
there, it will be a pretty sure sign that we're close to a
clearing. We've done enough flying for to-day, and
these Louisiana air currents are so changeable I don't
want to do any night traveling. If you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dere it vas some more!" cried Carl excitedly. "You
hear him dot time, Tick?"</p>

<p>"Aye, matey," answered Dick, "I heard a voice, fair
enough. It was a sort of screech, as though a woman
might have piped up&mdash;or a panther."</p>

<p>"Where away was it?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Two points off the starboard bow, Matt."</p>

<p>Matt shifted the rudder, thus altering the course of
the <i>Hawk</i>; he also depressed the horizontal plane and
threw the air ship closer to the tree tops.</p>

<p>"It's getting so blooming dark, down there among the
trees," observed Dick, "that it's hard to see anything,
but I believe I can make out a bit of a river, and an arm
of it like a bayou."</p>

<p>"Yah, so helup me," put in Carl, "I can see dot meinseluf,
I bed you. Und dere iss a light like a fire, vich
geds prighter und prighter as ve go aheadt. Vat you
t'ink is dot anyvay, Tick?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Dick could answer, the cry that had already
claimed their attention was wafted up from below, this
time so clear and distinct that there was no mistaking
it.</p>

<p>"<i>A moi! a moi!</i>"</p>

<p>It was a screech, as Dick had said, and resembled
greatly the yell of some wild animal; nevertheless, the
call was plainly human, for it was broken into words.</p>

<p>"French lingo, or I'm a Fiji!" averred Dick. "It's
the same as some one calling for help. And a woman,
too. No man could make a sound like that."</p>

<p>As if to prove Dick's words, the cry was repeated, but
the words were English, now, and not French.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!"</p>

<p>"Py chiminy grickets!" gasped Carl. "Dere iss someding
going on vat means drouple for der laty."</p>

<p>"We've got to land," declared Matt, "and see what's
the matter. Can you find a place?"</p>

<p>Both Dick and Carl were leaning over the forward
rail and staring ahead and downward.</p>

<p>Suddenly the tree tops broke away and a heap of
blazing wood could be seen. The fire had been kindled
on a cleared stretch of bayou bank, and not far from it
was a log hovel. But there was no one in sight, either
near the fire or around the hut.</p>

<p>The two boys on the lookout announced their discoveries
to Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"We'll come down on the bayou bank," said Matt.
"Give me directions, Dick."</p>

<p>The young Canadian, watching sharply below, called
their bearings to Matt, and the <i>Hawk</i> was safely man&oelig;uvred
to the surface of the ground. The calls for
aid had ceased, an ominous silence reigning in the vicinity
of the fire and the hut while the boys got out
their mooring ropes and secured the <i>Hawk</i> to nearby
trees.</p>

<p>"Where's the woman in distress?" queried Dick,
coming around the front end of the car and joining Matt
and Carl. "She was making plenty of noise, a while
ago, but she's quiet enough now."</p>

<p>"She may be in the hut," said Matt. "You stay here
and watch the air ship, Dick, while Carl and I take a
look through the shanty."</p>

<p>Matt pulled a blazing pine knot from the fire, and,
with this to light the way, started toward the hut. Carl
dropped in at his side and they proceeded onward together.
Suddenly Carl drew to a halt and laid a hand
on Matt's arm.</p>

<p>"I tell you someding, Matt," said the Dutch boy,
"und dot iss, I don'd like dis pitzness. Br-r-r! I haf
some greepy feelings all droo me."</p>

<p>Carl could be as brave as a lion when brought company
front with any danger he could understand, but
he was so full of superstition that if a black cat crossed
the road in front of him he was at once thrown into a
panic.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed Matt. "We're here to help
some one who is in trouble, and we don't want to get
scared at our own shadows."</p>

<p>"Der blace itseluf iss enough to make my shkin ged
oop und valk all ofer me mit coldt feet; and den, for
vy don'd we hear dat foice some more?"</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> a sort of weirdness about the place, and
no mistake. The great live oaks, uncannily festooned
with Spanish moss, completely inclosed the little clearing,
bending about it in a half circle and coming down
to the very edge of the bayou. The fact that there was
a fire, of course, proved that human beings had been in
the clearing, even if they were not there now. But
there was something ghostly about the fire, and while it
threw flickering shadows across the clearing it seemed
only to make the darkness deeper in the depths of the
wood.</p>

<p>"It may be, Carl," said Matt, "that the woman who
was calling for help has become unconscious. That
makes it all the more necessary for us to find her as
quick as we can. Come on!"</p>

<p>Waving his torch, Matt hurried along toward the
hut. The door was open, and the torch glare struck
whitely against some object suspended over it.</p>

<p>"Vatt iss dot ofer der door, eh?" asked Carl excitedly.
"Py shinks, it iss some pones! It iss a skeleton oof
someding! Whoosh! Dis iss gedding on my nerfs like
anyding."</p>

<p>The young motorist whirled on his Dutch chum.</p>

<p>"You go back to the air ship, Carl," said he, "and send
Dick here. Your nerves are troubling you so much that
you're not of much help."</p>

<p>Carl was only too ready to go back to the <i>Hawk</i>.
With a mumbled apology for himself, he turned and hurried
away. When Dick came up, a moment later, Matt
was looking at the object over the door of the hovel.</p>

<p>"What is it, matey?" queried Dick.</p>

<p>"It looks like the skull of a cat, or a dog," answered
Matt.</p>

<p>"Then I suppose it was put up there to bring luck.
People around here must be a jolly lot."</p>

<p>"We'll see what's inside," and Matt, holding his torch
high, passed through the door.</p>

<p>The hut contained but one room. There was a fireplace
in one end, and over a bed of coals a kettle was
hanging. A "shake-down" on the floor, in one corner,
was covered with ragged blankets. But the strangest
feature of the place was this: The whole under part
of the thatched roof, and every crevice of the walls, was
hung with rags, feathers, bones of cats, alligator teeth,
and a thousand other objects, equally curious.</p>

<p>"Well, strike me lucky!" mumbled Dick. "This is a
rummy old place we've got into. Between you and me
and the mainmast, old ship, I'd just about as soon give
it a good offing. But where's the woman that wanted
help?"</p>

<p>The question was hardly out of Dick's mouth before
it was answered by another screeching, "<i>A moi! a moi!</i>"</p>

<p>The call did not come from anywhere about the hut,
but from outside and somewhere in the timber.</p>

<p>"This way, Dick!" shouted Matt, and rushed out of
the hut.</p>

<p>"<i>A moi! a moi!</i>"</p>

<p>The call was again repeated, and the two boys, guiding
themselves by the call, flung up the slight slope and
darted in among the trees.</p>

<p>"Careful, matey!" panted Dick, from close behind his
comrade. "There's no telling what sort of a jolly mess
we're running into. Better dowse that light&mdash;it'll be
safer; besides, I can see the gleam of a lantern ahead,
there, through the trees."</p>

<p>"I just caught a sight of that myself, Dick," answered
Matt, in a low voice. "Your suggestion about the torch
is good," and Matt dropped the blazing fagot and
crushed out the fire with his foot. "Now, then," he
finished, "we'll go on, and go quietly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>A dozen yards, perhaps, brought the boys to a spot
from which they could behold a scene that caused their
pulses to leap.</p>

<p>An old crone was bound to a cypress stump, and beside
her stood a man with a lithe switch.</p>

<p>The hag was swarthy, and her kinky hair was white.
Evidently she was a mulatto. The man at her side was
white. The moment Matt's eyes rested on him, the
young motorist gripped Dick's arm with tense fingers.</p>

<p>"That man!" whispered Matt excitedly; "do you
recognize him, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Whistler, or I'm a Hottentot!" gasped Dick.</p>

<p>For a moment, blank amazement held the two boys
spellbound. Then, as Whistler lifted the switch and
brought it viciously down on the old woman's shoulders,
the spell was broken and the two boys started forward.</p>

<p>"Will you tell?" demanded Whistler, pausing after
the blow.</p>

<p>"<i>A moi! a moi!</i>" screeched the woman.</p>

<p>"You can call till you're blue in the face," went on
Whistler savagely, "and you'll not bring anybody. I'll
find out from you what I want to know, Yamousa, or
I'll flay you alive. Will you tell?"</p>

<p>At that moment, Matt and Dick broke into the lantern
light. The lantern was suspended from the broken limb
of a tree, and the glow was so faint that the boys had
not been seen until they were close upon the man and
the woman.</p>

<p>Whistler, with an oath of consternation, jumped backward.
The next moment, he had whirled his gad and
brought it down on the lantern. A crash followed, and
Stygian blackness shrouded the spot. A sound of running
feet, fading away in the timber, came to the boys'
ears.</p>

<p>"Never mind Whistler, Dick," said Matt; "let's look
after the woman."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">YAMOUSA.</p>


<p>No sound had come from the woman since the two
boys had reached the scene. Groping their way to her,
they found that she had become unconscious and was
drooping heavily in the cords that held her bound to the
stump.</p>

<p>"Of all the things that ever happened to us, mate,"
remarked Dick, "this captures the prize. We get cast
away on a little turtle back in the Bahamas, and Lat
Jurgens and this old hunks, Whistler, come to the island
in Nemo, Jr.'s submarine. We capture the pair and
leave 'em roped in our tent; then we capture the submarine.
Later we send ashore for Jurgens and Whistler
and the landing party reports that they have vanished.
Now, dropping down here in answer to a cry of distress,
we find Whistler giving an old woman a taste of the
cat. Whistler, of all men! I'm fair dazed with it all."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> For an account of the adventures of Motor Matt and his
friends in helping Archibald Townsend, otherwise Captain Nemo,
Jr., recover his stolen submarine from Jurgens and his rascally
followers, see No. 12 of the <span class="smcap">Motor Stories</span>, "Motor Matt's Peril;
or, Cast Away in the Bahamas."</p></div>

<p>"So am I," said Matt, "but we'll not let that bother us
now. This old woman has been brutally treated, and
has fainted away. We must get her to the hut and see
what we can do to revive her."</p>

<p>"Right-o," agreed Dick. "I've my sheath knife handy
and I'll cut her loose from that stump in a brace of
shakes."</p>

<p>Matt held the limp form upright while Dick severed
the cords; then, picking the woman up, they carried her
through the woods, back to the clearing, and laid her on
the ragged blankets in the hut.</p>

<p>"I think I saw a candle on the shelf over the fireplace,
Dick," said Matt. "Better light it."</p>

<p>Dick found the candle. It was a tallow dip stuck in
an old tin candlestick. With the light in his hand, he
walked to the old woman's side and bent downward.</p>

<p>The face of the woman was scarred and hideous.
There were big gold earrings pulling down the lobes of
her ears, and another large ring pierced her nose and
fell down over her upper lip. Her cheeks were hollow,
and the yellow skin resembled parchment. Her clothing
was a motley garb of patched rags. Two claw-like
hands, with finger nails an inch long, lay on the blankets
beside her.</p>

<p>Matt lifted his eyes to Dick's with a shudder.</p>

<p>"She's not what you'd call Cinderella, exactly,"
grinned Dick, "and I don't think her beauty will ever
prove fatal."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," said Matt, "she's a woman and needs help.
That's enough for us to know."</p>

<p>A tin water pail stood on a bench, and there was a
gourd dipper hanging over it. Matt filled the gourd
and returned and dashed the water in the old woman's
face.</p>

<p>The effect was magical. With a screech that caused
the boys to start backward in consternation, the old
woman sat up suddenly and glared about her, with eyes
like coals. Abruptly her attention fixed itself on the
boys and she began to croon in a harsh, mumbling voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Si to te 'tit zozo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et moi-meme mo te fusil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mo sre tchoue toi&mdash;<i>Boum!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She exploded the last word like the crack of a revolver,
lifting and aiming her fingers as she might have
done with a weapon.</p>

<p>"Avast, there, old lady!" cried Dick. "We're friends
of yours. Can't you understand that?"</p>

<p>"American?" shrilled the woman, rising slowly to her
feet.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Where is ze man zat take me from my home and
beat me wiz ze stick?" she demanded, crouching like
a cat, while her talon-like hands clawed the air angrily.</p>

<p>"He ran away," answered Matt. "We cut you loose
from the stump and brought you here. Do you know
that man?"</p>

<p>The old woman staggered to the fireplace and stirred
up the coals under the kettle; then she turned back, took
the candle out of Dick's hand and studied his face.
From Dick she turned to Matt, giving him a similar
scrutiny.</p>

<p>Her eyes were bright and fiery&mdash;age had not seemed
to dim them. As she turned from Matt, the hag gave a
croaking laugh.</p>

<p>"I guess we'd better send the 'blue peter' to the masthead,
old ship," said Dick, "trip anchor and slant away.
This don't look like a comfortable berth, to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"You not go 'way yet," cried the woman, whirling
about. "You are ze good boys, you help Yamousa, ze
Obeah woman, and by gar, Yamousa help you! Sit on
ze bench."</p>

<p>She waved one hand toward the bench on which the
water pail was standing. Dick, heeding a significant
look from Matt, followed to the bench and sat down.</p>

<p>"Do you know that man who was beating you?" asked
Matt, again, determined if possible to get a little information
about Whistler.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>, I know heem!" answered the woman, with a
spitting snarl. "One time he work on ze sugar plantation
near ze bayou, and he come many time to see Yamousa
and have her tell him ze t'ings he do not know.
He come now from ze Bahamas and ask about ze iron
chest, and where zis Townsend take heem. But Yamousa,
she no tell. For why Yamousa no tell, eh?
Well, she see zat Whistler haf ze bad heart. Whistler
try to beat her, <i>make</i> her tell; zen ze American boys
come and drive heem away. How you get here, eh?"</p>

<p>"We came in an air ship," Matt answered.</p>

<p>"<i>Sacre tonnere!</i> I know zat you come&mdash;I seen him in
ze smoke."</p>

<p>Yamousa had said things which had aroused the intense
curiosity of the two boys. Whistler had tried to
force her into telling him the whereabouts of an "iron
chest." That iron chest had been found in a sea cavern
of an uninhabited island among the Bahamas, had been
taken aboard Townsend's submarine, and had been in
the submarine when Matt and his chums turned the
boat over to her owner on the Florida coast. Townsend
had taken the chest to New Orleans, and Jurgens and
Whistler were eager to recover it.</p>

<p>What the chest contained, no one knew. A man who
called himself simply the "Man from Cape Town" had
given Townsend a chart and secured his promise to
find the chest, carry it to New Orleans, and open it in
the presence of a woman whom the Cape Town man
claimed was his daughter. These two were then to
divide the contents between them.</p>

<p>The fact that Whistler, and presumably Jurgens, as
well, still had designs on the chest, was surprising information
for Matt and Dick. The three boys were proceeding
to New Orleans in the <i>Hawk</i>, in response to a
request from Townsend; and it might easily chance that
the business which had led Townsend to call Motor
Matt and his friends to New Orleans was to cross the
evil designs of Jurgens and Whistler.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about that iron chest, Yamousa?"
inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"Not now, but I find heem out," replied the old
woman. "By gar, I find out anyt'ing zat ees wanted
to be known."</p>

<p>"You say you knew that we were coming?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui.</i>"</p>

<p>"I can't understand how you discovered that. We
didn't know ourselves we were coming until we got a
telegram at Palm Beach, Florida, yesterday."</p>

<p>"I tell by ze smoke," repeated the woman; "I read
heem in ze smoke."</p>

<p>"What sort of a place is this, anyhow?" muttered
Dick to Matt uncomfortably. "Is the old lady a fortune
teller? I never took much stock in that sort of thing,
you know."</p>

<p>"Yamousa ees ze Obeah woman," chirped the hag, her
ears having evidently been sharp enough to overhear
what Dick had said: "I am ze voodoo queen. I know
t'ings ozzers don't know, an' ze people come from ever'where
to see Yamousa&mdash;from New Orleans, <i>oui</i>, and
from Algiers, Plaquemine, St. Bernard&mdash;all up and
down ze river an' ze coast&mdash;zey all come to haf Yamousa
tell zem t'ings zat zey don't know. I tell you ze
same. You are my franes&mdash;<i>mes amis</i>&mdash;an', I do planty
mooch for you. Where is ze ozzer of you? In ze smoke
I see t'ree, all in ze flying boat zat come to Bayou
Yamousa."</p>

<p>"She means Carl," muttered Dick, "and how the old
Harry she knew anything about him is a fair dazer."</p>

<p>"In ze smoke I see heem," replied the hag, again
catching Dick's words.</p>

<p>"I think I'm beginning to see through this a little,
Dick," said Matt. "In some way, Jurgens and Whistler
got off that island in the Bahamas and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Zey hide in a cave till you go 'way," broke in Yamousa,
"an' zen zey come out an' bymby ze boat come
from ze Great Bahama an' pick zem off. <i>Oui, hé</i>, zey
ees bot' ver' bad an' haf ze bad heart."</p>

<p>"How did you find that out, Yamousa?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Not in ze smoke, not zat, <i>non</i>. Whistler tell me."</p>

<p>Yamousa's knowledge, which, for the most part,
seemed to be derived from unusual sources, filled Matt
and Dick with growing bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Sink me," muttered Dick, "but my nerves are beginning
to bother me. Go on, though, matey. What about
Whistler?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's still after the iron chest, he and Jurgens.
They got away from that turtle back in the Bahamas,
landed in this vicinity, and Whistler came here to get
this voodoo priestess to tell him where he could locate
the chest."</p>

<p>"All my eye and Betty Martin, that! Just as though
Yamousa could tell him!"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, Whistler must have thought so or he
wouldn't be here. We saw and heard enough to convince
us that what Yamousa said about his designs was
true. We got here in time to drive him off and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just there occurred a startling interruption. A
frantic yell came from the clearing&mdash;a yell that was
plainly given by Carl.</p>

<p>"More trouble!" boomed Dick, leaping from the bench,
"and it's Carl that's flying distress signals now."</p>

<p>Matt did not reply, but he led the way to the door
and through it into the dying glow of the fire on the
bayou bank.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE ATTACK ON THE CAR.</p>


<p>Carl was having a fight. Matt and Dick were able
to discover that much as they rushed from the house.
And the fight was against hopeless odds, for at least a
dozen men could be seen in the faint glow of the fire.
They were pressing around the car, and Carl, standing
in Matt's chair, was laying about him with a long-handled
wrench, keeping the attacking force temporarily
at bay.</p>

<p>"Keelhaul me!" cried Ferral, as he raced after Motor
Matt. "What does that gang mean by making a dead-set
at the <i>Hawk</i>? They're negroes, the lot of them!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's one white man, Dick!" answered Matt.
"Whistler is there. He must have recognized us in the
woods and he's setting the negroes on to smash the
air ship, or else capture it."</p>

<p>"The confounded swab! He'll not find it so easy, I
warrant you."</p>

<p>Whistler, leaving the negroes to get the better of
Carl, was working at one of the mooring ropes. This
made it look as though he was trying to steal the air ship
rather than to destroy it.</p>

<p>Carl, sweeping his makeshift weapon in a fierce circle
about him and now and then bowling over a negro who
came too close, caught sight of his two chums hustling
for the scene.</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" Carl bellowed. "Here comes my bards,
und now you fellers vas going to ged more as you
t'ought. Dere vill be doings now, und don'd forged dot!
Slide indo der scrimmage, Matt, you und Tick! It vas
going to be some hot vones, I dell you dose."</p>

<p>Just then the wrench hit a negro and knocked him
off his feet.</p>

<p>"Dot vas me," yelped Carl, "und I gif you some
sambles oof vat you vas to oxpect! I peen der olt Missouri
Rifer, py shinks, und ven I shvell my banks den
it vas dime peoples took to der hills! I vas der orichinal
Pengal diger, fresh from der chungle und looking to
gopple oop vatefer geds in my vay! Ach, vat a habbiness!
Sooch a pooty fighdt vat it iss!"</p>

<p>It was perhaps a sad thing, yet nevertheless true, that
Carl Pretzel loved a fist fight better than he loved a
square meal; and that was saying a good deal&mdash;for Carl.</p>

<p>While he was fighting it was his custom to waste a
good deal of valuable breath boasting about his own
prowess and taunting his foes. Just now he was the
old Missouri River and the original Bengal tiger, both
rolled into one. But he had hardly finished introducing
himself to the negroes before one of them hit him with
a stone. The wrench dropped from Carl's hand and he
turned a back somersault over the rail of the car. Before
he could get up, half a dozen husky negroes had
piled on top of him and he was helpless and unable to
make a move.</p>

<p>Matt and Dick, bearing down with all speed upon
Whistler, saw their chum as he tumbled out of the car.
They could not do anything for Carl at that moment,
however, as Whistler had straightened erect and flung
a hand to his hip.</p>

<p>The boys knew what that motion meant. Whistler
was a desperate man, and as quick to use a revolver,
when he had one, as he was to use his fists when he
hadn't.</p>

<p>"Land on him&mdash;before he can shoot!"</p>

<p>As Dick yelled the words, Matt cleared the distance
separating him from Whistler with a wild leap. His
body struck Whistler's squarely, and with a terrific impact.
Both went down and rolled over and over on the
ground.</p>

<p>The revolver, which Whistler had just drawn from
his pocket, fell from his hand. Dick saw it and was less
than a second in grabbing it up.</p>

<p>"We've drawn Whistler's fangs, mate," he shouted to
Matt, who had regained his feet. "He'll not trouble us,
and this piece of cold steel will give the negroes something
to think about. Break away, there!" and Dick,
flourishing the weapon, jumped for the crowd that had
laid hold of Carl.</p>

<p>The negroes, from what Matt could see of them, appeared
to be laborers from some neighboring plantation.
Nearly all of them were big and powerful, but ran to
brute strength rather than to science.</p>

<p>The attack on the car, there was no doubt, had been
engineered by Whistler. He recognized in Matt and his
friends a source of peril, and by capturing the <i>Hawk</i> and
injuring one or more of the boys, he would be able to
reduce the peril to a minimum.</p>

<p>It had been strange, indeed, that the boys should have
encountered their old enemy there on the bank of that
Louisiana bayou. But Whistler, either acting for himself
or in conjunction with Jurgens, was scheming to
regain possession of the iron chest. Inasmuch as the
chest was presumably still in the hands of Townsend, the
man whom Matt and his friends were going to New
Orleans to meet, there was a reason for Whistler and the
boys being in that part of the country at the same time.
So their meeting was not such a remarkable coincidence,
after all.</p>

<p>The sight of the revolver threw the blacks into a
panic. Those who had captured Carl sprang away from
him and retreated warily toward the edge of the timber.
At the same time, the others began to draw back from
the car.</p>

<p>"Go for 'em, you cowards!" yelled Whistler, scrambling
to his feet. "You're getting a dollar apiece, all
around, for this, but by thunder you've got to earn it."</p>

<p>"Keep away from this air ship," shouted Matt sternly,
posting himself near the end of the car. "The man who
lays a hand on the <i>Hawk</i> does so at his own peril."</p>

<p>"Never mind him!" bawled Whistler, "Sail into 'em
with stones if you can't do any better."</p>

<p>Stones could be used at fairly long range, and the negroes,
screened by the shadows of the timber, began at
once to act upon Whistler's suggestion. Missiles, large
and small, began raining down upon the boys, banging
against the car, slapping into the silken envelope of the
gas bag, and menacing the motor. Something would
have to be done, and quickly, or disaster would overtake
the <i>Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>"Stay with the <i>Hawk</i>, Carl!" shouted Matt. "This
way, Dick! We've got to scatter those fellows into the
timber or they'll put a hole in the gas bag or do some
damage to the motor."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Matt flung away in the direction of the
timber line. With a whoop, Dick followed him. Before
Matt had got half way to the timber, he was struck in
the shoulder and knocked down. Half stunned, and
with his whole right side feeling as though it was paralyzed,
he rose to his knees.</p>

<p>Dick had fared little better. A rock, thrown by one
of the black men, had hit the revolver he was carrying
and knocked it from his hand. The weapon flew off
somewhere in the darkness, and while the stones continued
to hail through the air, Dick went down on all
fours and tried to locate the six-shooter.</p>

<p>"Now you've got 'em!" came the voice of Whistler.
"They've lost the gun and are all but done for. Rush
'em!"</p>

<p>The negroes, considering that they were only receiving
a dollar each for helping Whistler, were putting
a lot of vim and ginger into the one-sided combat.</p>

<p>Giving vent to exultant yells, they rushed from the
timber and, in a few minutes more, would have overwhelmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Matt and his friends by sheer force of numbers.
But the unexpected happened.</p>

<p>From the door of the hut came old Yamousa, her tattered
garments flying about her as she ran. Over her
head she held a gleaming white skull&mdash;either of a cat
or a dog&mdash;and the picture she made, gliding through the
firelight, was enough to awe the fiercest of the superstitious
blacks.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she screeched. "Zis ees somet'ing I will not
have. Zese boys are my franes&mdash;<i>mes amis</i>&mdash;an' I will
not haf zem hurt. You hear? T'row one more stone
an' Yamousa puts <i>obi</i> on ze lot of you, ev'ry las' one.
How do you like zat, you niggers? How you like ze evil
eye on you?"</p>

<p>Instantly the headlong rush of the blacks was stopped.
Halting in trepidation, they drew together, hands drooping
at their sides and every ounce of hostility oozing out
at their finger tips.</p>

<p>The boys were amazed at the old woman's power.
Under the spell of their superstition, the negroes were
held as by iron chains.</p>

<p>"Don't let the old hag fool you!" shouted Whistler.
"She can't hurt you as much as those white boys can if
you leave 'em alone. They came out of the sky in their
bird ship, and if you don't capture them they'll put
something worse than the evil eye upon you. Never
mind Yamousa!"</p>

<p>A murmuring went up from the blacks and they began
to move undecidedly.</p>

<p>Hissing like an enraged wild cat, Yamousa flung herself
forward and laid the skull she was carrying in the
forward end of the car, just where the firelight would
show it to the eyes of the black men.</p>

<p>"Ze white man talk," she screamed, tossing her arms,
"an' what he say ees nozzing. You know what Yamousa
can do&mdash;how she can spoil ze luck an' bring ze
long sickness. Zis air ship ees under ze protection of
Obboney. Touch heem if you dare! An' zeese white
boys are my franes&mdash;hurt zem an' you hurt me. Shall
I put ze spell on you? Spik!"</p>

<p>Lifting herself to her full height, Yamousa raised her
skinny arms and waved her talon-like hands. A yell of
fear went up from the blacks. To a man they fell on
their knees, imploring the Obeah woman not to work
any evil spells.</p>

<p>Whistler raged and fumed, but all to no purpose.
The negroes were completely dominated by Yamousa
and would not listen to him.</p>

<p>"Zis white man who gif you ze dollar apiece to do zis
what you try," went on Yamousa, "come to Yamousa's
place zis night, drag her to ze stump in ze wood, tie her
zere an' beat her wiz ze stick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roars of consternation went up from the blacks.</p>

<p>"Zese white boys save Yamousa," the hag went on,
"an' now you come an' try to keel zem an' take zeir bird
ship! <i>Sacre tonnere!</i> Me, I put <i>obi</i> on zat white man
wiz ze black heart! You catch heem, bring heem to me,
give heem blow for blow zat he struck Yamousa, an' I
gif you each ze lucky charm. Zat ees better zan a dollar
each, eh?"</p>

<p>By then the blacks were completely under Yamousa's
influence. As she finished, they sprang up and made a
rush for Whistler. That worthy, understanding well
how cleverly he had been worsted, took to his heels and
fled into the timber, the blacks whooping and yelling,
and pushing him hard.</p>

<p>"You all right now," said Yamousa, turning to the
boys with a cackling laugh. "Come back in ze house
while I show you somet'ing in ze smoke."</p>

<p>"I don'd vant to shtay py der <i>Hawk</i> mit dot t'ing!"
whooped Carl, pointing to the white skull. "My nerfs
iss vorse as dey vas, a heap! Don'd leaf me alone,
bards!"</p>

<p>"You go on with Matt, Carl," said Dick, "and I'll
stay and watch the air ship. I guess there's not much
danger now, anyhow. Yamousa has got the negroes
under her thumb in handsome style, and Whistler will
have his hands so full looking after himself that he
won't be able to try any games with the air ship."</p>

<p>Carl was not in love with the idea of going into the
house; still, he liked it better than staying out in the
open all by himself. A supernatural twist had been given
to the course of events and Carl was anything but easy
in his mind. When Matt followed Yamousa back toward
the hut, Carl took hold of his arm and kept close beside
him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SMOKE PICTURES.</p>


<p>"Sit on ze bench," said Yamousa, when they were all
in the house again, pointing to the bench where Matt and
Dick had rested themselves a little while before.</p>

<p>Carl made it a point to keep a grip on Matt, and he
walked with him to the bench and snuggled up close to
his side when they sat down. The Dutch boy's eyes
were almost popping from his head. The queer assortment
of odds and ends with which the roof and walls
were decorated cast over him a baneful spell, and he was
beginning to wish that he had stayed with the car.</p>

<p>Yamousa hobbled back and forth, getting together materials
for the work she had in prospect. First, she took
an earthen jar from one corner of the room and set it
down in front of the boys. As she moved across the
floor with the jar she sang the Creole song which Matt
had already heard, finishing by aiming her finger at Carl
and shrieking out the final "<i>boum!</i>"</p>

<p>Carl gave a howl of consternation, his feet went into
the air, and he would have tumbled from the bench if
Matt had not held him.</p>

<p>"Donnervetter!" gasped Carl huskily. "I dradder be
some odder place as here. Vat's der madder mit der olt
laty? She gifs me some cholts."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," whispered Matt. "She has proved
herself a friend of ours."</p>

<p>"Yah, meppy, aber I don'd vant her to boint her
finger ad me like dot some more."</p>

<p>Yamousa got a small box from a cupboard and
emptied a brownish powder out of it into the jar; then,
with a pair of tongs, she removed a live coal from the
fireplace and dropped it into the jar with the powder.</p>

<p>A wisp of smoke floated upward, accompanied by a
sizzling noise. The noise increased until it resembled the
buzzing of a swarm of bees, and the smoke spread out
until it filled all that part of the room, growing denser
every moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>In and out through the vapor, stumbling around the
jar in a sort of dance, moved Yamousa, tossing her arms
and crooning a chant.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Di tems Missié d'Artaguette,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hé! Ho! Hé!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C'était, c'était bon tems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yé té ménin monde a la baguette,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hé! Ho! Hé!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The boys stared breathlessly. Yamousa's candle was
on the other side of the room, glowing like a coal
through the vapor.</p>

<p>Suddenly figures began to take shape in the smoke,
the filmy fog thickening in places and decreasing in
others as though some invisible hand was moulding the
black haze into a scene <i>en silhouette</i>.</p>

<p>By degrees the picture perfected itself until, at last,
it lay clearly before the boys.</p>

<p>They saw a broad river on which a small boat was
floating. There was no one in the boat, but on the stern
thwart, in plain view and unmistakable, was Townsend's
iron chest.</p>

<p>The boat and the chest heaved and rolled on the
waves, and the oars in the oarlocks played up and down
on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Then, as the two boys watched, scarcely breathing, so
great was their interest and excitement, a vague shape
came gliding over the river out of the distance. Presently
the shape resolved itself into the form of the air
ship. The <i>Hawk</i> glided low and halted hoveringly over
the boat.</p>

<p>There were three passengers in the air ship's car, and
Matt and Carl had no difficulty in recognizing themselves
and Ferral. A rope was thrown downward by
Ferral, and Matt could be seen climbing over the rail
and descending the rope.</p>

<p>On reaching the boat, Matt made the rope secure to
the iron handles of the chest and Carl and Dick laid back
on the rope and drew the chest upward.</p>

<p>The moving picture had proceeded thus far when Carl,
overcome by the uncanny nature of the whole proceeding,
lifted a hair-raising yell, hurled himself from the
seat, and bolted for the door.</p>

<p>The frenzied shout seemed to destroy the spell. The
smoke billowed shapelessly into a blank fog, and Matt
darted from the house after Carl.</p>

<p>Dick, startled by the Dutch boy's shout, had run
toward the cabin, meeting Carl a few yards from the air
ship.</p>

<p>"Der olt laty vas der teufel," Carl was excitedly explaining
to Dick. "She makes moofing bictures, py
shinks, oudt oof nodding but shmoke. Ve see der air
ship, und meinseluf, und you, und Modor Matt, und ve
vas doing some t'ings vat I don'd know und vat ain'd
peen done, yah, so helup me. Led's ged avay from here,
mitoudt losing some more time."</p>

<p>Carl was in a nervous condition, and while he talked
he jumped up and down and flourished his arms. When
he was through, he made a bolt for the <i>Hawk</i>, but Matt
was close enough to catch hold of him.</p>

<p>"Don't get excited, Carl," said Matt. "Calm yourself
down."</p>

<p>"How I vas going to do dot," exploded Carl, "ven I
see der hocus-pocus dot olt laty make mit us? Himmelblitzen!
She iss some relations mit der Olt Nick,
und oof ve know ven ve vas vell off ve vill pull oudt oof
here righdt avay."</p>

<p>"Chuck it, Carl!" said Dick. "I guess there ain't anything
going to hurt you. Give me a line on this, Matt.
I can't overhaul Carl's talk and get much sense out
of it."</p>

<p>Matt proceeded to describe what had taken place in the
hut. Dick listened with wide eyes.</p>

<p>"Keelhaul me if I ever heard anything like that before!"
he exclaimed, when Matt had finished. "It sounds
like a yarn for the marines. You two must have been
hypnotized and imagined you saw all that. Fakirs in
India do stunts of that sort, but they only make people
<i>think</i> they see such things; they don't really see them."</p>

<p>"I know ven I see somet'ing, you bed my life," fluttered
Carl, "und I see der air ship, und you and Matt und
meinseluf in der shmoke, und ve do t'ings schust so
natural like life. It don'd vas some treams, I tell you
dot. Oof&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carl was interrupted by a shrill cry from the hut door.</p>

<p>"Come once more an' see ze smoke picture! Come
queek!"</p>

<p>"Nod me!" and Carl galloped on toward the air ship.</p>

<p>"We'd better go, Dick," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Do you think Carl will try to unmoor the <i>Hawk</i>?"
returned Dick, with a hurried look in the direction Carl
had gone.</p>

<p>"No, he won't do that."</p>

<p>Matt and Dick thereupon retraced their course to the
hut. Yamousa had vanished from the door and the boys
groped their way through the stifling, pungent vapor to
the bench.</p>

<p>The smoke picture had already been formed and
showed the interior of a room with stone walls. On the
floor of the room lay a man, bound hand and foot and, to
all appearances, a prisoner. He had gray hair and mustache,
and his features, although vague and indistinct,
were easily recognized.</p>

<p>"Townsend!" whispered Matt.</p>

<p>"Aye!" returned Dick, "Townsend, as I live!"</p>

<p>The stone chamber faded into the front of a building,
and along the front was a sign, the lettering of which
could easily be read: "M. Crenelette, Antiques."</p>

<p>This second picture faded and Yamousa laid a piece of
board over the top of the jar. Slowly the air cleared
and the old woman stepped close to the bench, shaking
her withered head until the gold rings in her ears and
nose danced glimmeringly.</p>

<p>"You know ze man in ze stone room?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Matt, in a stifled voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Zat will be in New Orleans. Me, I live
zere one time. Ze front of ze buildings you see has ze
stone chamber in ze basement. Eet ees in Royal Street,
on ze French side of Canal. You look an' you fin' ze
sign, zen you get ze white-haired man away from ze enemies.
Go 'way an' sleep; zen, in ze morning, I gif you
breakfus, an' you go on to ze big city an' safe your
frane. <i>Bo' soir, mes amis!</i> Sleep an' do not fear."</p>

<p>Without answer, Matt and Dick stumbled out of the
house, full of wonder and bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky!" breathed Dick. "This is the first
time anything like that ever crossed my hawse. The
question is, is there anything in it, or is it all a fake?"</p>

<p>"I don't take much stock in wonder-workers like Yamousa,"
answered Matt, "because they usually prey upon
the ignorant and the superstitious. I haven't the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
notion how she make the pictures. That part of it is
strange enough, and maybe, as you say, she only hypnotizes
us and causes us to think we see something that
isn't really in the smoke at all. But I don't see how
those pictures can really mean anything, and I'm going
to bunk down in the car and get some sleep."</p>

<p>Matt tried to persuade himself that the smoke pictures
of Yamousa were merely a trick, but somehow the idea
that there <i>might</i> be something in them clung to his mind.
Although his thoughts kept him unsettled and restless
for a time, yet he finally fell asleep.</p>

<p>There was no sleep for Carl, however. He found the
revolver that had been knocked out of Dick's hand by
the flying stone. The mechanism had been damaged and
the weapon was useless, but nevertheless Carl felt safer
with it, and placed himself on guard.</p>

<p>Dick, like Matt, was able to get some rest, and the
night passed uneventfully. It was only when morning
dawned that anything of an unusual nature occurred.</p>

<p>A shout from Carl brought Matt and Dick to their
feet. Carl had retreated until he was standing midway
between the air ship and the edge of the clearing, his
fearful eyes on Yamousa, who was crouching at the side
of the car.</p>

<p>"Queek!" cried Yamousa, "hurry away. Your enemies
come&mdash;I see zem in ze smoke&mdash;an' zey come close.
Leesen!"</p>

<p>She held up one talon-like finger in token of silence.
From somewhere, off in the timber, could be heard faint
sounds as of some one approaching through the undergrowth.</p>

<p>In another moment the boys were actively at work
casting off the ropes.</p>

<p>"Take zis," said Yamousa, handing Matt something
wrapped in a piece of newspaper. "It will breeng you
ze luck. You haf helped Yamousa, an' Yamousa she try
to help you. But hurry; zere ees no time to lose."</p>

<p>Carl, gathering courage from the prospect of an early
departure from that ill-omened spot, ran forward and
helped Dick with the ropes.</p>

<p>Matt laid the small parcel Yamousa handed to him in
the bottom of the car and immediately got the engine to
going. The woman, meanwhile, with an apprehensive
look over her shoulder, had started toward the timber.</p>

<p>As Dick and Carl leaped into the car, Yamousa gave
a screech of warning and pointed toward the other side
of the cleared space.</p>

<p>One look in that direction was enough for Matt. Half
a dozen white men had hurried into sight. Whistler was
in the lead.</p>

<p>"Let 'er go, matey!" yelled Dick. "They'll be on us
in half a minute."</p>

<p>Matt, with a twist of a lever, threw the power into
the machinery and the <i>Hawk</i> took the push and glided
upward.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A QUEER FIND.</p>


<p>Had the boys been a minute later in casting loose,
there would certainly have been trouble&mdash;and perhaps
they would not have been able to get away at all.</p>

<p>Whistler, who was well in advance of the others,
strained every nerve to reach the car, but the <i>Hawk</i> was
well in the air before he reached the spot where it had
been moored. Neither he, nor any of those with him,
seemed to be armed. No shots were fired, and Whistler
shook his fist upward and shouted maledictions.</p>

<p>"Py chiminy," whooped Carl, "ve'll led him vistle
some. He ought to be good at dot."</p>

<p>Swiftly the clearing vanished behind the <i>Hawk</i>, and
the tops of the trees soon hid it entirely.</p>

<p>Carl drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"I vas nefer so habby ofer anyt'ing as I vas to ged
avay from dot blace," he averred. "Der olt voman vas
pad meticine, und ve vas lucky dot ve vas aple to ged
avay ad all."</p>

<p>"Avast there, matey!" answered Dick. "Yamousa
tried to be a friend of ours."</p>

<p>"I don'd like friendts vat iss so spookish," went on
Carl, kicking the cat's skull off the front of the car and
watching it tumble into the green tree tops below.
"Dere iss all kindts oof drouples come oof sooch pitzness."</p>

<p>"She said she looked into the smoke and saw Whistler
and those other fellows coming," muttered Dick.</p>

<p>"Meppy she dit, und meppy she saw dem, or heard
dem."</p>

<p>"If she saw Whistler and his outfit in a smoke picture,"
went on Dick, "and then came to warn us, it not
only proves that she means well, but that there's something
in that smoke business."</p>

<p>Matt smiled a little.</p>

<p>"We'd better forget all that happened last night,
pards," said he. "We can't make head or tail out of it,
anyhow, and I don't believe in worrying over things you
can't understand. We helped Yamousa; and Yamousa,
in her own way, has tried to befriend us. Suppose we
let it go at that and sponge out the occult part of it?
The biggest, and possibly the most amazing discovery we
made, was that Whistler got clear of the Bahamas and
seems to have got this far on the trail of the iron chest.
If Whistler is on the trail, no doubt Lat Jurgens is, also.
Perhaps Townsend knew about this when he telegraphed
us to come to New Orleans."</p>


<p>"I hope nothing has happened to Townsend," murmured
Dick, his mind reverting to the smoke picture he
had seen.</p>

<p>"There you go again," laughed Matt. "You're still
thinking of what Yamousa showed us, and imagining
there may be something in it. Cut it out, Dick. If
there's anything in the picture we'll know it before long.
Dip into the ration bag and get out some breakfast&mdash;I'm
nearly starved."</p>

<p>While Dick held to the post of lookout, Carl drew on
the food supply and all hands ate a cold breakfast.</p>

<p>After the meal the boys passed an hour discussing
Jurgens and Whistler, their designs on the iron chest,
and the way they had probably escaped from the sand
key in the Bahamas. For the most part, the discussion
led nowhere. The boys could make guesses, but unless
they were to put their faith in what Yamousa told them,
their talk could bring them to nothing definite.</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by Dick.</p>

<p>"Mississippi, ho!" he cried. "The river's dead ahead,
mates, and hard under our forefoot."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Matt. "We'll follow the river to
New Orleans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where we going to keep der air ship when we reach
der city?" inquired Carl.</p>

<p>This was always a conundrum to the boys. The
<i>Hawk</i> was so big and unwieldy, and withal so easily
damaged, that to stow it away where it would be safe
from wind and storm was a difficult problem.</p>

<p>"We might anchor the <i>Hawk</i> on some scow in the
river," suggested Dick, "and then put the canvas cover
over her. If we find we're going to stay in New Orleans
long, it might pay to build a roof over the scow."</p>

<p>"That would cost too much," objected Matt. "It
would take a mighty high roof to clear the top of the
gas bag, and a mighty big one to cover it. Why not
berth her on one of the docks? The docks are high,
they're roofed, and there's always a watchman in
charge."</p>

<p>"Right-o!" said Dick. "You've tagged on to the right
rope, old ship. We'll use the docks. Stuyvesant Dock
will about suit us. I was in this port once on the old
<i>Billy Ruffin</i>. We coaled over in Algiers, and some of
us had shore leaves. A great town, that, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carl, who had been leaning over the rail, went limp
and white all of a sudden and looked around with staring
eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, mate?" demanded Dick,
startled by the Dutch boy's manner. "Sick?"</p>

<p>"N-o-o," gurgled Carl, "I vas vat you call flappergasted&mdash;so
astoundet mit vat I see dot I can't shpeak.
Look ofer der site, und see vat you see py der rifer.
Ach, du lieber! I don'd know vat to t'ink."</p>

<p>Matt had already swerved the <i>Hawk</i> into an upstream
course. The murky waters of the Mississippi
lay no more than a hundred feet below, and the light,
variable winds were helping rather than retarding the
air ship.</p>

<p>Matt and Dick both cast downward looks over the
guard rail, and what they saw caused them to straighten
erect and stare at each other in amazement. For a moment
or two, neither could speak.</p>

<p>Ahead of them drifting downstream with the current
was a skiff. Although there were oars over the
skiff's sides, trailing in the water, the boat was empty.</p>

<p>In the stern sheets, however, was the iron chest!</p>

<p>The boys had seen that particular iron chest so many
times that they were perfectly familiar with its appearance.</p>

<p>During the interval that passed while the lads were
staring at each other, before the mental eyes of all of
them floated that smoke picture seen the evening before
in Yamousa's hut.</p>

<p>"Der olt Nick has somet'ing to do mit dot," muttered
Carl, drawing one hand over his puzzled eyes.</p>

<p>"It's the queerest find I ever heard of!" stuttered Dick.
"From the way you described that first smoke picture to
me, Matt, this event is fitting into it in a way that takes
my breath."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it might be a coincidence," mumbled Matt, hardly
knowing what to believe, now that he was face to face
with such a reality.</p>

<p>"Coincidence nothing!" averred Dick bluntly. "Yamousa
has powers we never dreamed of. She may be a
clairvoyant, or something like that."</p>

<p>"I never took much stock in clairvoyants," demurred
Matt.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, there's the chest. In some manner it's
got away from Townsend."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Matt, throwing aside the uncanny feeling
that had come over him. "No matter how we happened
to make this queer find, nor how little we understand
the manner in which we made it, our duty is clear.
We've got to recover the chest, find Townsend, and turn
it over to him."</p>

<p>"Stand by, then, to go aboard the skiff," called Dick.
"Port your helm, Matt. I'll do the conning for you."</p>

<p>"Keep away!" shouted Carl. "Don'd go near dot poat
und don'd fool mit dot safe. It's pad meticine! Eferyt'ing
iss pad meticine vat has anyt'ing to do mit dot olt
laty. Ach, blitzen, I vish ve hatn't seen dot poat!"</p>

<p>But Matt and Dick knew what their duty was and paid
little heed to Carl's protests.</p>

<p>Guided by Dick, Matt brought the <i>Hawk</i> within a
dozen feet of the boat, cut off the power, and the air ship
hovered in the air, motionless save for the slight influence
of the wind. Dick tossed a rope over the side.
Matt, leaving his seat among the levers, prepared to get
over the rail and lower himself into the boat.</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better go, matey?" queried Dick. "I'm
used to sliding up and down ropes and backstays."</p>

<p>"You and Carl stay here and make ready to hoist the
safe aboard," replied Matt. "I'm a pretty fair hand at
rope climbing."</p>

<p>Probably none of the boys thought, at that moment,
how closely they were copying the smoke pictures shown
Matt and Carl by Yamousa. That smoke scene seemed
to have depicted the event with the sureness of fate.</p>

<p>Matt dropped over the side quickly, in order to get
into the boat before the <i>Hawk</i> should drift away from it.
He succeeded in carrying out his design and, still clinging
to the rope, stepped from the gunwale of the skiff
to one of the midship thwarts and then into the stern.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the boat to show who the occupant
had been. A bailing tin lay in the bottom, but there
was absolutely nothing else in the skiff apart from the
iron chest.</p>

<p>"Work quickly, old ship!" Ferral called down. "The
wind is freshening and we'll be blown away from you if
you don't hustle."</p>

<p>Swiftly, Motor Matt secured the end of the rope to
one of the iron handles.</p>

<p>"Haul away," said he, stepping back.</p>

<p>Carl and Dick seized the rope and began to pull. The
chest rose slowly into the air; and then, when it was
lifted about half way, one of the sudden gusts of wind
which the <i>Hawk</i> had been encountering all along the
Gulf coast struck the air ship, and she leaped sideways
nearly to the shore of the river.</p>

<p>Carl and Dick secured the rope frantically. While the
chest continued to swing below the car, Dick jumped into
the levers and got the propeller going. This gave him
a better command of the air ship and he attempted to
man&oelig;uvre the craft back and into Matt's vicinity.</p>

<p>Again and again he tried, but, as the wind was now
high and shifting quickly from one quarter to another,
no success attended his efforts.</p>

<p>"Take the chest aboard," Matt cried, standing up in
the skiff and making a trumpet of his hands, "and go on
to town. Berth the <i>Hawk</i> on one of the docks, if you
can, and, if you can't, make a landing farther inland.
I'll follow you."</p>

<p>There was nothing else to be done, and Matt watched
the <i>Hawk</i> bear away up the river, Dick at the motor and
Carl heaving in the chest by slow degrees.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">FOUL PLAY.</p>


<p>Matt was greatly worried over the way that experience
with the boat and the chest had worked out. Dick
knew enough about handling the air ship to be able to
look after her in ordinary weather, but those shifting air
currents had bothered even Matt. It was so easy for
some little thing to go wrong and either wreck or cause
irreparable damage to an air ship. In that respect, an
air ship was totally unlike any other craft.</p>

<p>But there had been no other way out of the dilemma
and Matt, facing the situation with all the grace he
could muster, dropped on the midship thwart, seized the
oars, and headed the skiff upstream.</p>

<p>Fortune favored him a little, for a lugger from the
oyster beds came lurching up the river, all sails set and
bound for the landing. Matt hailed the lugger and the
oysterman took him aboard.</p>

<p>He said nothing to the lugger's crew as to how he had
happened to be in the skiff. Had he done that, one explanation
would have led to another and it would have
been necessary to speak of the iron chest&mdash;a subject
which it was well enough to keep in the background.</p>

<p>When the lugger tied up at the landing, Matt left the
skiff with her crew and went ashore. His object now
was to find Carl, Dick, and the <i>Hawk</i>, and he made his
way along the river front in the direction of Canal
Street. He could see nothing of the <i>Hawk</i> in the air,
but along the wharves he encountered several groups of
roustabouts who were talking excitedly about the "flying
machine" that had recently passed over the town.</p>

<p>By making inquiries, he learned that the <i>Hawk</i> had
settled earthward in the vicinity of the Stuyvesant
Docks. Instructions were given him as to the best way
for finding the docks, and he hurried on.</p>

<p>Fully three hours had passed since the chest had been
recovered and the <i>Hawk</i> and Matt had parted company.
A good many things could happen in three hours, and
Matt continued to feel worried.</p>

<p>As he was passing the Morgan Line Docks he saw
Dick bearing down on him. The look of elation in
Dick's face was indirect evidence that all was right with
the <i>Hawk</i>.</p>

<p>"Hooray!" shouted the Canadian. "You were so long
turning up, matey, that I was afraid something had happened
to you. I hope we won't ever again part company
like we did down there on the river. Confound this
Louisiana wind, anyhow! It never blows twice from the
same direction, seems like. You didn't row all the way
to town against the current?"</p>

<p>"If I had, Dick," answered Matt, "I couldn't have got
here before night. A lugger picked me up. Where's the
<i>Hawk</i>?"</p>

<p>"Safely berthed on the big dock. I gave the dock
watchman a five-dollar note to look after her and keep
curious people away. We've stretched a rope around the
air ship and no one can get within a dozen feet of her.
She's as snug as possible, and there couldn't be a better
place for her. Why, the dock's better than that old balloon
house in South Chicago!"</p>

<p>"Where's Carl?"</p>

<p>"He went away with Bangs, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bangs? Who's Bangs?"</p>

<p>"Why, he introduced himself to Carl and me as soon
as we got the <i>Hawk</i> moored. He's a friend of Townsend's
and has been hanging out on the levee looking for
us ever since Townsend sent that telegram asking us to
come. He was there by Townsend's orders, and was to
tell us where to berth the <i>Hawk</i> and where to go our
selves."</p>

<p>"I should think Townsend would have been there to
meet us," observed Matt.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right&mdash;Bangs explained that point.
Townsend is full of business, these days, and asked
Bangs as a favor to watch for us."</p>

<p>"What did you do with the iron chest?"</p>

<p>"Bangs and Carl took it away in an express wagon.
As soon as Carl delivers the chest to Townsend, he's
coming back to the docks. I told him that, by that time,
you'd probably be there, and that we could all go up to
see Townsend. Bangs said that Carl would surely get
back to the docks by noon."</p>

<p>As Dick finished speaking, the noon whistles took up
their clamor.</p>

<p>"Did Bangs identify himself in any way?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Why, no," answered Dick, puzzled. "It was identification
enough, I thought, to have him meet us, tell us
all about Townsend, and say Townsend had sent him to
watch for us."</p>

<p>"That might be a yarn, Dick, with not a particle of
truth in it."</p>

<p>"But he was on the levee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everybody up and down the river front could see the
<i>Hawk</i>, so you were known to be coming. Well, maybe
everything is all right. Carl went with Bangs and the
chest, anyhow. He'll see that the chest is properly delivered."</p>

<p>"Bangs insisted on either Carl or me going with him
to see Townsend," pursued Dick, "and that gives the
whole business a straight look. If there was anything
crooked about Bangs he wouldn't have wanted any one
to go with the chest, see?"</p>

<p>Dick was so honest himself that he was rarely looking
for treachery in others. Matt made no response to what
he had just said, but turned the subject, as they walked
together in the direction of the Stuyvesant Docks.</p>

<p>"Did you have any trouble making a landing, Dick?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"There was a big freight boat alongside the docks and
she blanketed us against the wind. If it hadn't been for
the freighter, Carl and I might have had more than we
could attend to. We just grazed the steamer's stacks,
ducked under the dock roof, and rounded to as neat as
you please. We were lucky rather than skillful, you see,
for it would have been an easy matter to smash the
<i>Hawk</i> into smithereens."</p>

<p>The boys continued on along the levee, and on every
hand the queer craft that had dropped out of the sky
was the topic of conversation. Not many people were
allowed on the dock where the <i>Hawk</i> was moored, but
there were a few curious ones clustered around the
guard rope and surveying the craft.</p>

<p>Carl Pretzel, however, was not in evidence.</p>

<p>"He's probably been delayed," suggested Dick. "We'll
just hang around and wait for him."</p>

<p>While they were waiting, the watchman came up to
them.</p>

<p>"It's none o' my business," said he, "and I reckon
you'll think I haven't any call buttin' in, but that feller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
that drove away with your friend, in the express wagon,
hasn't got a very good character in this town."</p>

<p>"Is that straight?" queried Dick.</p>

<p>"Straight as a plumb-line. He's as crooked as a dog's
hind leg. Proctor used to run a boat on the river, but he
took to drinkin' an turned 'shady,' an' now he's not
much better than a loafer. I'd have told you before, only
I supposed you knew what you was doin' an' that you
wouldn't thank me to interfere. I heard Proctor say,
though, that your friend would sure be back here by
noon. Well, it's noon, an' he ain't here. That's why
I'm talkin' now."</p>

<p>"Proctor?" cried Dick. "Why, he said his name was
Bangs."</p>

<p>"He's been known to change his name before now, so
I ain't surprised at that. But his real name is Proctor."</p>

<p>The watchman went on about his business, and Matt
and Dick withdrew by themselves in no very easy frame
of mind.</p>

<p>"Dowse me!" growled Dick. "Can't Carl and I be
away from you for a few hours, old ship, without making
fools of ourselves? But Bangs told such a straight
yarn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If a trap was laid, Dick," interposed Matt, "it was a
clever one and I don't see how you could avoid dropping
into it. It's a pretty safe guess, I think, that there
has been foul play. This fellow Proctor, or Bangs,
wanted the iron chest and laid his plans to get it."</p>

<p>"But how could he lay his plans?" muttered Dick.
"Sink me if I can understand that part of it. First off,
he couldn't have known we had the iron chest, seeing
that we fished it out of that skiff so recently."</p>

<p>Matt listened thoughtfully. He was trying to figure
the matter out in his own mind, but it was a difficult
problem.</p>

<p>"Then, again," continued Dick, "Bangs was here
watching for us. If he wasn't a friend of Townsend's
how could he have known we were coming?"</p>

<p>"From what we knew of Archibald Townsend," answered
Matt, "we can bank on his being honest and
square. If that's the case, he'd hardly have a friend like
Bangs, would he? And certainly, if he knew Bangs,
he'd hardly trust him to meet us, as Bangs told you he
had done."</p>

<p>"I'm a swab," growled Dick, with profound self-reproach,
"and Carl's a swab. We've dropped into a
tangle of foul play, and it don't make it any brighter because
we can't understand where Bangs got the information
that enabled him to carry out his plot. I had an
idea that I wouldn't let Bangs touch that iron chest until
you got here, but he told such a straight story that I was
argued out of my original intention. Oh, keelhaul me!"</p>

<p>Dick fumbled in his pocket for a handkerchief. When
he drew it out, a bit of crumpled newspaper came with it.</p>

<p>"Ah," muttered Dick, picking up the bit of paper,
"maybe Carl will have some luck. He unwrapped that
little parcel Yamousa gave you as we were leaving the
bayou. What do you think we found in it?"</p>

<p>"A rabbit's foot?"</p>

<p>"No, a dried frog! Carl, before he started away in
the express wagon, put the frog in his pocket. He said
he'd try it out before he turned it over to you. If we're
right in thinking that Bangs is playing a treacherous
game, then Carl will have plenty of chance to find out
what the charm is good for."</p>

<p>"We've got to be doing something, Dick," said Matt.
"We can't hang around and wait for the dried frog to
help Carl."</p>

<p>"We might slant away and look up that expressman,"
returned Dick. "He could probably tell us where he took
Carl, and Bangs, and the box."</p>

<p>"A good tip!" exclaimed Matt. "We'll go on a still
hunt for the expressman."</p>

<p>After reassuring himself that the <i>Hawk</i> would be
safely looked after by the watchman, Matt and Dick left
the docks and began hunting for the man who had been
hired by Bangs to take the iron chest into the town.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DRIED FROGS&mdash;AND LUCK.</p>


<p>Mr. Bangs had a very dark complexion, black hair,
black eyes, and a ropy black mustache. His face had
a puffed, unhealthy look&mdash;probably due to dissipation&mdash;and
his walk was a sort of slumping process which
proved, beyond the power of words, that he was dead to
ambition and lost to hope. In the worst sense of the
term, he had ceased to live for himself and was living
for others&mdash;a mere tool for the unscrupulous whenever
there was a dollar to be turned.</p>

<p>And yet there was something very plausible about
Bangs. He had an engaging way with him, whenever he
desired to put it forward, and he used it to the limit when
accosting Dick and Carl on the docks.</p>

<p>Carl, no less than Dick, believed firmly that everything
was all right, and that Bangs was really the friend of
Townsend and had been sent to the levee to watch for
the air ship. It pleased the Dutch boy to think that he
was to go with Bangs and the iron chest, and he was
delighted with the dried frog amulet, which Matt had
seemed to forget about since leaving the bayou.</p>

<p>Of course Carl believed in charms. Having a wholesome
regard for Yamousa's powers, it was natural for
him to have abundant faith in the dried frog. Stowing
the relic away in his pocket, he mounted the express
wagon with the utmost confidence, waved his hand to
Dick, and then rolled away with Bangs, the expressman,
and the iron chest.</p>

<p>Carl's "luck" began the moment the express wagon
turned into Canal Street. The old, square stone flagging,
in that part of town, was deeply worn. The front
wheel of the wagon on Carl's side plunged into a rut,
and Carl fell forward on the backs of the mules and
then rolled down under their heels.</p>

<p>The hind heels of a mule are dangerous objects to
tamper with, and in less than half a second the expressman's
team got very busy.</p>

<p>Carl distinctly remembered pitching over upon the
backs of the mules, and he had a hazy recollection of
slipping down inside the pole, but after that he drew a
blank. When he opened his eyes and looked around, he
was sitting up in the street, supported by Bangs. The
expressman was picking up his hat, and a crowd was
gathering.</p>

<p>"It was a right smart of a jolt," grinned one of the
bystanders.</p>

<p>"Don't you-all know it's bad business t' tampah with
the south end of a mu-el goin' no'th?" asked another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Vas it an eart'quake?" inquired Carl, mechanically
taking his hat. "Der puildings vas shdill shdanding on
der shtreet, und nodding vas dorn oop mooch, aber
somet'ing must haf habbened."</p>

<p>"You done drapped on de mu-els," said the colored
proprietor of the express wagon. "Dey's gentle, an'
dey'll eat oats off'n de back of a choo-choo engyne, but
dey won't stan' fo' no meddlin' wid dey feet."</p>

<p>"Hurt?" inquired Bangs, helping Carl erect.</p>

<p>"Vell," answered Carl, feeling himself all over, "dere
don'd vas any vone blace vere I feel der vorst, but dere
iss a goneness all ofer me, oop und down und sideways.
Oof I hat a gun," he finished, his temper rising, "I vould
go on a mule hunt."</p>

<p>Carl slapped the dust from his clothes and climbed
back into the wagon. Before he gripped the seat with
both hands, he transferred the dried frog from the left-hand
pocket of his coat to the right-hand pocket.</p>

<p>"Meppy I ditn't put it in der righdt blace," he thought.</p>

<p>The express wagon turned from Canal Street into
Royal, and from Royal into St. Peter, halting before a
dingy building, with iron balconies, not far from Congo
Square.</p>

<p>A mulatto woman sat in the doorway of the building
with a basket of pralines in front of her on the walk.
Carl took one handle of the chest, and Bangs the other.
The chest, being of iron, was heavy. Somebody had
spilled a pitcher of milk on the sidewalk and Carl's foot
slipped as he crossed the wet spot. His end of the chest
dropped, barking one of his shins and landing on the
toes of one of his feet.</p>

<p>Carl gave a yell of pain and toppled over, sitting down
with a good deal of force in the basket of pralines. The
praline vendor had been knitting, but she sprang up,
when she saw the destruction the Dutch boy was causing
to her stock in trade, and tried to make a pin cushion of
him with her knitting needles.</p>

<p>Bangs rushed to the rescue, and Carl, after placating
the woman with a silver dollar, once more picked up his
end of the chest and limped after Bangs.</p>

<p>The doorway through which they passed led them into
a narrow, ill-smelling corridor, open to the sky and filled
with rubbish. Out of the rubbish grew a number of untrimmed
and uncared-for oleander bushes.</p>

<p>"Now," remarked Bangs, not unkindly, "you can sit
down here and rest. I'll have the creole gentleman who
lives here help me up to Townsend's room with the
chest; then I'll tell Townsend about you, and he'll come
down and give you a hearty greeting."</p>

<p>"Mebby I pedder go mit der chest?" objected Carl.</p>

<p>A look of pained surprise crossed Bangs' face.</p>

<p>"You don't think for a moment, my dear friend," said
he, "that I'm trying to deceive you? I merely wish to
announce your coming to my friend Townsend so that
he'll come down here personally and give you welcome."</p>

<p>"Ach, vell go aheadt," muttered Carl, dropping down
on a box near a clump of oleanders and nursing his foot.</p>

<p>Bangs gave a whistle. The creole gentleman, barefooted
and wearing a red flannel shirt and tattered trousers,
appeared in the courtyard from nowhere in particular,
and he and Bangs passed a few words in French.
The creole gentleman grinned a little and laid hold of
one of the iron handles. Bangs took the other, and they
carried the iron chest up a stairway to a gallery on the
second floor.</p>

<p>Carl watched the two mount the stairs and pass around
the gallery to a door; then the door opened and the two
men and the iron chest disappeared. The creole gentleman
did not show himself again, and if he left the
room into which he had gone with Bangs he must have
passed out by some other way than the gallery.</p>

<p>The moment Carl was by himself, he changed the
dried frog to the breast pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>"I don'd got him in der righdt blace for luck," thought
Carl. "Meppy dot iss pedder. Oof I lif long enough
to ged der frog vere he ought to be, I bed you I haf
some goot fortunes."</p>

<p>While Carl leaned back, and waited, there came a
shrill cry from behind another clump of oleanders:</p>

<p>"Get out of here! Get out! Get out! Sic him,
Tige!"</p>

<p>Carl, fearing the onslaught of a dog, snatched up a
piece of wood and jumped to the top of the box. No
dog came.</p>

<p>"Don'd you set some dogs on me!" he called. "I got
as mooch righdt here as anypody. I vas vaiding for
Misder Downsent. Who you vas, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"You're the limit!" came the shrill words. "Go soak
your head! Police! Police!"</p>

<p>As the last word rang through the courtyard, Carl's
cap was jerked off his head from behind. With an
angry shout, he whirled just in time to see the branches
shaking as the thief got away.</p>

<p>"I'm der limid, am I?" he muttered, crashing through
the bushes. "Want me to go soak my headt, hey? Vell,
py chiminy, I show you somet'ing."</p>

<p>When Carl got through the bushes the thief had disappeared,
but a wild, rollicking laugh came from behind
the other thicket of oleanders. Running in that direction
he came upon a yellow-crested parrot chained to
a perch. The parrot seemed to be getting a good deal
of fun out of the situation, for he was lifting himself
up and down and chuckling fiendishly.</p>

<p>"Vy," gasped Carl, a slow grin working its way over
his face, "it vas a barrot! Pooty Poll! Sooch a nice
pird vat it iss! Vant some crackers? Say somet'ing,
vonce, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just at that moment, something hit Carl on the back
of the head. Whirling away from the parrot, he looked
upward. A black monkey was clinging to the ironwork
of the gallery overhead. In one paw the monkey
held Carl s cap, and with the other paw he was fishing
bits of plaster out of the wall and throwing them downward.</p>

<p>"Und dere iss a monkey, too!" exclaimed Carl. "It
looks like I vas in a menacherie. Say, you monk, gif
me dot hat!"</p>

<p>"Sic 'im, Tige!" shrilled the parrot. "Police! police!"</p>

<p>The monkey chattered and flaunted the cap defiantly,
at the same time getting ready to throw another piece of
plaster.</p>

<p>"Nice leedle monk!" wheedled Carl. "Iss der leedle
monkey hungry? Den come down und ged some peanuds
vich I ain'd got! Pooty leedle monk! py shinks,
I vill preak you in doo oof you don'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Biff!</p>

<p>The piece of plaster came downward, straight as a die,
and landed on Carl's chin. That was more than Carl's
temper could stand, and he started up the stairway toward
the gallery.</p>

<p>In order to get near the monkey he had to run around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the gallery, past the door through which the creole gentleman
and Bangs had vanished with the chest.</p>

<p>There was a window, set in a sort of embrasure, beside
the door, and one of the lights was broken out.</p>

<p>As Carl passed under the window, on his way around
the gallery, he heard a voice that brought him to a gasping
halt. All thoughts of his stolen cap, and the monkey,
left his mind.</p>

<p>Staggering up against the balcony rail, he stood there
blinking in stunned bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Vas I ashleep?" he whispered; "vas I treaming? I
vonder oof I can pelief vat I hear, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off his words abruptly, turned and stepped
to the wall. Here he paused just long enough to shift
the dried frog from his coat to his trousers pocket, then,
softly, climbed into the embrasure and peered through
the broken pane of the window.</p>

<p>No, he had not been asleep, or dreaming.</p>

<p>He was peering into a room in which were two men,
neither of whom was the creole gentleman.</p>

<p>One of the men was Bangs, and the other was&mdash;Lat
Jurgens! Between them stood the iron chest.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE PLOTTERS.</p>


<p>"You're a good one, Proctor!" Jurgens was saying,
leaning over the chest and rubbing his hands. "This is
the biggest piece of luck that ever came my way. Did
Whistler have anything to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Whistler?" returned Bangs. "How could he have
anything to do with it? He's not in town."</p>

<p>"I know that, but he went to see the voodoo woman
to try and have her give him a line on the chest. He
left yesterday, and here the chest drops into our hands.
It looks to me as though old Yamousa had been giving
us a helping hand."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" returned Bangs disgustedly, "Yamousa didn't
have a thing to do with it. I was waiting for that air
ship to come in, accordin' to that telegram Townsend
sent to Motor Matt and which you found out about. It
came, but there were only two boys in the car. They
landed on Stuyvesant Dock, and they hadn't any more
than got the craft secured before I was right there. I
told 'em the yarn we had framed up&mdash;how Townsend
was expecting them but was so busy he couldn't come,
so had sent me." Bangs chuckled. "They swallowed
the yarn, all right," he went on. "While I was talking
I saw the iron chest in the car. Say, that almost took
me off my feet. However did it happen to get into the
hands of those boys?"</p>

<p>"Pass the ante, Proctor. Didn't they tell you?"</p>

<p>"Nary a word. They said Motor Matt would be along,
in a little while, but that's all they told me about him.
I suggested that one of them go with me to take the
chest to Townsend, and the Dutch boy was the one who
came. He's down in the courtyard now, waiting for
Townsend to come and give him a welcome."</p>

<p>Bangs dropped into a chair as he finished and gave
vent to a low laugh.</p>

<p>"Didn't they ask you how Townsend had come to get
separated from the chest?" asked Jurgens.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And what did you tell 'em?"</p>

<p>"The truth; that the chest had been stolen from
Townsend. Even then the two boys wouldn't tell me
where they had found the chest. I reckon Motor Matt,
who seems to be pretty long-headed, must have warned
them to keep mum."</p>

<p>Jurgens continued to chuckle and rub his hands.</p>

<p>"Blamed if things aren't coming our way better than
I had imagined they would!" he exclaimed. "This is
rich, and no mistake. And you say the Dutchman is
down in the court?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"Waiting for me to slip down and give him the glad
hand?"</p>

<p>"That's what he's waiting for," guffawed Bangs.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll give him the hand, all right, but there'll
be something in it. We've got to take care of him, in
some way, until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Whatever Jurgens' plans were concerning Carl they
did not appear. Fate, at that moment, hastened events
toward a conclusion.</p>

<p>The square window, against which Carl was leaning
and listening, was far from secure. In his interest and
excitement, he bore rather harder upon the window
than he intended. As a result, the window suddenly
gave way and Carl fell crashing with it into the room.</p>

<p>Just how much the dried frog in Carl's pocket had
to do with the mishap is for those versed in superstitious
lore to answer. Ever since he had taken possession
of the charm he had encountered a run of hard luck, but
everything that had so far happened to him was trivial
as compared with this final catastrophe.</p>

<p>Before he could get to his feet he had been pounced
upon by Bangs and Jurgens, dragged clear of the broken
glass and held firmly down on his back.</p>

<p>"He's not so much of a fool as you thought, Proctor!"
growled Jurgens. "He was in the window, listening."</p>

<p>"Much good it'll do him!" grunted Bangs. "We've
got the chest, and what he discovered won't do him any
good."</p>

<p>"You bet it won't! Get a rope."</p>

<p>Bangs secured a rope from somewhere in the room
and Carl was expeditiously lashed by the hands and feet.</p>

<p>"Himmelblitzen!" ground out Carl. "You vas a humpug,
Pangs! You say you vas somet'ing, und you peen
somet'ing else. Py chincher, oof I hat der use oof my
handts I vould make you t'ink you vas hit mit some
cyclones."</p>

<p>"Oh, come," laughed Bangs, "don't be so fierce.
We've got you, and we've got the chest, and that pal
of yours is away off on Stuyvesant Dock and hasn't the
least notion where you are. Sing small, my fat kiskidee;
it won't do you any good to take on."</p>

<p>"Vait, py chinks!" flamed Carl; "schust vait ondil
Modor Matt findts oudt vat iss going on. Den, I bed
you, someding vill habben. I don'd know nodding, und
Tick he don'd know nodding eider; aber Matt&mdash;vell,
dere iss a feller vat knows more as you. Look oudt
for him, dot's all."</p>

<p>"Where is Motor Matt?" demanded Jurgens.</p>

<p>"Ask me," said Carl.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm doing."</p>

<p>"Veil, keep on; und ven I dell you somet'ing, schust
led me know. Churgens, you vas a pad egg, und you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
vill ged vat's coming by you vone oof dose tays. How
you ged off dot islant in der Pahamas?</p>

<p>"Ask me," taunted Jurgens.</p>

<p>"Vat a frame-oop!" muttered Carl dejectedly. "Look
here, vonce: Vere iss Downsent?"</p>

<p>"Ask me again," said Jurgens mockingly.</p>

<p>"How you steal dot chest from him?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you that," grinned Jurgens.
"The information can't possibly harm us, because we'll
be out of the way long before you can tell any one; and
I'd like to have Motor Matt, who's been bucking us
ever since we first went on the trail of the chest, know
just what we've done to his friend Townsend.</p>

<p>"Townsend bobbed up off the levee in that submarine
boat of his, a few days ago, and Whistler and I were
on hand watching for him to arrive. He got here at
night, unloaded the chest, and had a man start for town
with it on a wheelbarrow. It was a foolish thing for
Townsend to do&mdash;try to wheel the chest away with
only himself and the man at the wheelbarrow to look out
for it."</p>

<p>Jurgens paused and gave Bangs a wink.</p>

<p>"Townsend never got to the place he was going with
that chest, eh, Proctor?" he continued. "We'd just
lowered the chest into a rowboat when a couple of
watchman came along. We got off from the levee to
wait until the watchman got past, and then, when we
went after the boat, it had disappeared. We hunted
good and hard for it, but haven't seen the boat since.
Whistler went to talk with a voodoo woman he used
to know to see if she could tell him what became of the
boat and the chest. He hasn't got back yet; but here's
the chest, big as life, all safely locked and ready for
us to open it. Where did you fellows pick up the chest,
Dutchy?"</p>

<p>"Talk aboudt der vedder," suggested Carl.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you don't want to loosen up you needn't.
We knew you were coming here to help Townsend.
Townsend sent you a telegram&mdash;or, rather, Cassidy, one
of his men, sent the telegram the next day after we got
hold of the chest. Townsend hadn't shown up on the
submarine, but Cassidy had his orders, I reckon. An
assistant of mine was shadowing Cassidy, and he discovered
the contents of the message. After that, I had
Proctor down on the river front waiting for you to
arrive in the <i>Hawk</i>. Proctor was surprised when he
found that you were bringing the chest with you. It
was a joyful surprise for all of us, and you and Ferral
dropped into Proctor's trap too easy for any use. I
wonder if you've got anything of importance about your
clothes? Search him, Proctor."</p>

<p>Carl never had much money, and very little else of
any importance, in his pockets. He had nothing, now,
but, as Bangs knelt beside him and began his search,
Carl thought instantly of the dried frog.</p>

<p>So far from being a luck bringer, the frog was a
hoodoo. Carl was thoroughly convinced of that; and he
had a feeling that no good fortune could come his way
so long as he kept Yamousa's charm in his pocket. He
wanted to unload it, and he would rather unload it
upon Bangs or Jurgens than any one else. If he could
give them the same run of hard luck that he had been
having, it might be easier for Matt to recover the chest.</p>

<p>"I don'd got nodding," said Carl, squirming and playing
a part which he had swiftly mapped out for himself.</p>

<p>"I reckon what he says is true," Bangs reported, having
discovered only a jackknife, a fishline, a stump of
a lead pencil, and a ham sandwich. "He's panning out
mighty slim, Jurgens. If&mdash;&mdash; Ha! what's this?"</p>

<p>Bangs pulled the dried frog out of Carl's hip pocket,
looked at it curiously and held it up for Jurgens' inspection.</p>

<p>"Great guns!" exclaimed Jurgens. "It looks like a
dead frog."</p>

<p>"Gif it pack!" cried Carl, to all appearances greatly
perturbed. "It vas Moder Matt's charm, his luck pringer.
It don'd vas vort' anyt'ing to you."</p>

<p>"Motor Matt's luck bringer, eh?" muttered Bangs.
"Well, from all I heard of that fellow his luck has been
phenomenal. Do you want this thing, Jurgens?"</p>

<p>"Not I, Proctor," answered Jurgens.</p>

<p>"Then," went on Bangs, coolly appropriating the
charm, "I'll just take it myself and see if some of Motor
Matt's luck won't come my way."</p>

<p>"I thought you didn't believe in such things?"</p>

<p>"No more I don't, but I'm going to test this amulet
and see what it will do for me."</p>

<p>"Take efervt'ing else vat I got," begged Carl, "only
gif me pack dot charm!"</p>

<p>"Not on your life!" said Bangs. "If it's so valuable
to Motor Matt it ought to be worth just as much to
me."</p>

<p>Carl, it is needless to say, was delighted to have the
trouble maker in Bangs' possession. It was the first
bright spot in his experiences since leaving the docks
with Bangs and the expressman.</p>

<p>"Get a cold chisel and a hammer, Proctor," said Jurgens,
briskly; "it's high time we got the chest opened
and pulled out with the treasure."</p>

<p>"You leaf dot chest alone!" fumed Carl.</p>

<p>"Yes?" laughed Jurgens. "Well, hardly. Just lie
there, Dutchy, and see us dig out more treasure than
you ever set eyes on in your life before. When you
leave here, you can tell Townsend how we got away
with the loot. Inform him, for me that Lat Jurgens
wasn't born yesterday, and that it will take a better man
than Nemo, Jr., to get the best of him."</p>

<p>At that moment, Bangs came up with a cold chisel
and a hammer and fell to work on the treasure box.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE HEAD OF OBBONEY.</p>


<p>Carl's pleasure in getting rid of the charm was rather
tempered by this attack on the iron chest.</p>

<p>That chest had had a checkered career. Where the
Man from Cape Town got it, or what he had put into
it, no one knew. The Man from Cape Town had declared
that it contained treasure, and he had drawn a
chart, showing an uninhabited sand key in the Bahamas
and indicating a cave on the key where the chest could
be found.</p>

<p>The chest had passed rapidly into the hands of Jurgens
and Whistler, then into the possession of Motor
Matt and his friends, then to Townsend, then back to
Jurgens, then once more to Motor Matt, and now, for
the final time it seemed, to Jurgens. All these changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
were attended with more or less violence and astonishing
adventure.</p>

<p>With keen eyes Carl watched proceedings. Sturdy
blows of the hammer drove the point of the cold chisel
into the old lock, destroyed its mechanism and rent it
apart. As Bangs dropped his hammer and chisel and
prepared to lift the lid, Jurgens approached and leaned
over excitedly.</p>

<p>"There ought to be enough treasure in that chest," said
he to Bangs, "to make Whistler and you and me independent,
Proctor."</p>

<p>A gleam arose in Bangs' watery black eyes and a
deeper red ran into his puffy face.</p>

<p>"All I want's enough to keep me in liquor," said
Bangs.</p>

<p>"It's a modest ambition," returned Jurgens. "I've got
other plans for myself&mdash;but every man his own way.
Lift the lid."</p>

<p>The heavy cover grated on its hinges as Bangs
pushed it back. The chest appeared to be filled with
brownish particles. With a disappointed oath, Jurgens
scooped up a handful of the particles and held them
close to his eyes.</p>

<p>"Sawdust!" he exclaimed; "mahogany sawdust!" and
he cast the stuff from him fiercely.</p>

<p>"That's your treasure, is it?" sneered Bangs. "That's
what we've been workin' for, and playin' tag with the
law for, and gettin' into trouble for, is it? Pah!" Bangs
got up disgustedly. "I was a fool ever to go into this
thing. That Man from Cape Town has been playin' a
joke. Sawdust! A box of sawdust!"</p>

<p>Carl chuckled, but the two men were so wrought up
they did not hear him, or pay any attention to him. Carl
felt sure that the dried frog was getting in its work.
The spell of the hoodoo was over Jurgens, and Bangs,
and the iron chest.</p>

<p>Of course, Carl was wide of his reckoning when he
allowed his thoughts to take this course. But, then,
he was superstitious.</p>

<p>Why Yamousa, a friend of Matt's, should want to load
him up with hoodoo and tell him it would bring him
luck, was a point Carl had already considered. He explained
that point, to his own satisfaction at least, by
imagining that the charm would bring luck to Matt
alone, and bad luck to everybody else. Explanations are
always easy when a fellow wants to prove anything!</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Proctor," called Jurgens.</p>

<p>Bangs had started for the door with the evident intention
of going away and washing his hands of the
whole affair. At this call, however, he turned back.</p>

<p>"Well?" he queried.</p>

<p>"I'll bet money there's something in here besides sawdust.
Let's not form any snap judgments till we dig
to the bottom."</p>

<p>"Pirates don't pack pieces-of-eight in sawdust!"
scowled Bangs.</p>

<p>"Pirates didn't have anything to do with this treasure.
It came from South Africa and was brought to the
Spanish Main in a modern ship."</p>

<p>"You half told me Cap'n Kidd had stowed that away
on Turtle Key!"</p>

<p>"I said that to get you interested, and secure your
help."</p>

<p>"And I've rung the creole gentleman that owns this
house in on the deal! Well, you'll have to make it right
with him, that's all."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of the creole gentleman!"</p>

<p>With that, Jurgens turned the chest upside down,
pushed it away and began kicking the heap of sawdust
right and left.</p>

<p>Something was found&mdash;but it was not what Jurgens
and Bangs seemed to hope for.</p>

<p>A round object rolled out of the brownish particles
and stopped rolling directly at Jurgens' feet. Jurgens
leaped back with a startled exclamation, and stood staring.
Bangs muttered something, and backed away.</p>

<p>The round object was a carved head&mdash;and as hideous
a bit of work as Carl had ever seen. The eyes were
black and beady, and set under heavy overhanging brows;
the nose was wide at its base and suggested the negroid
type; the mouth had thick lips and was twisted into a
grin. But it was not a mirthful grin the face wore&mdash;far
from that. There was something demoniacal, menacing
and uncanny in that petrified grin&mdash;something that
caught the heart with clammy hands and sent chill after
chill along the nerves.</p>

<p>Carl turned his face away. Bangs, with a terrified
yell, jumped for the door, but Jurgens grabbed him before
he could get out of the room.</p>

<p>"Hold up, you fool!" stormed Jurgens. "Are you
going to run from a piece of carved wood?"</p>

<p>"Hanged if I want to be anywhere near that thing!"
palpitated Bangs. "Let's get out of here!"</p>

<p>"Wait. Put a clamp on your nerves and don't make
a fool of yourself."</p>

<p>Leaving Bangs to watch him with bulging eyes, Jurgens
returned to the head and picked it up.</p>

<p>"There are letters carved in the top of it," said he.</p>

<p>"Do they spell anything?" whispered Bangs, moistening
his dry lips with his tongue.</p>

<p>"'Obboney.' That's what I make out of them."</p>

<p>"What's Obboney?" queried Bangs. "Does it mean
anything? If it does, what?"</p>

<p>"Dere iss a baper in der sawdust," spoke up Carl,
whose interest in the head was about as terrifying as
Bangs.</p>

<p>Jurgens looked down, saw a bit of white in the sawdust,
then reached for it and shook it clear of the
brown particles. He unfolded a note, written on parchment
or some sort of tanned skin.</p>

<p>"Well!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Bangs, anxiously.</p>

<p>"It's a key to the mystery. Listen."</p>

<p>Thereupon Bangs read the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'The Head of Obboney. Read and give heed, for
the head of Obboney contains many things, perilous and
otherwise to human beings.</p>

<p>"'Obboney is a malicious deity of the Koromantyn, or
Gold Coast negroes, of Africa; he is the author of all
evil, and when his displeasure is signified by the infliction
of pestilential disorders, or otherwise, nothing
will divert his anger but human sacrifices; and these
sacrifices are selected from captives taken in war, or, if
there be none, then from the slaves of the Koromantyns.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Jurgens paused. The paper shook in his fingers and
fell fluttering to the floor. He lifted a hand to his face
and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" demanded Bangs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Jurgens, hoarsely. "Do you
smell a peculiar odor in this room?"</p>

<p>"I've been smelling that for several minutes. Where
does it come from?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know, but it seems to lay hold of muscle
and brain, like&mdash;like poison."</p>

<p>Jurgens had been holding the head of Obboney in the
crook of his left arm. Just when he finished speaking,
the head dropped with a thump into the sawdust; Jurgens
staggered back, tried to recover his balance, failed,
and crumpled to the floor.</p>

<p>"Are you sick?" demanded Bangs, stepping hurriedly
to Jurgens' side.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know what's the matter with me," whispered
Jurgens. "Some&mdash;some infernal power has&mdash;has
laid hold of me and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His head sank back, his limbs relaxed, and he lay with
closed eyes, silent save for his stentorous breathing.</p>

<p>Carl was also conscious of a slow stupor creeping
through his nerves.</p>

<p>"Let me oop!" he gasped, struggling to sit up. "Take
der ropes off oof me und led us ged oudt oof here. Oof
ve don't leaf, ve vill be deadt men pefore you can say
Chack Ropinson!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but where does that&mdash;that odor come from?"
demanded Bangs, himself rapidly losing consciousness.</p>

<p>"From&mdash;from der headt!" stuttered Carl, wildly.
"Take it avay! Trow it from der vindow! It iss pad&mdash;pad
meticine! It vas a hootoo, py shinks, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carl's words faded into silence. Like Jurgens, he
fell backward and began breathing heavily.</p>

<p>Bangs stared for a moment, then staggered toward the
door, intent on reaching purer air. But he never gained
the entrance. The mysterious odor claimed him and he
sank to the floor with a hollow groan.</p>

<p>He tried to roll away, but gave a gasp and his senses
left him.</p>

<p>Thus the malicious Obboney was doing his deadly
work.</p>

<p>The head, lying face upward in the sawdust, grinned
vindictively and the jetty eyes glittered.</p>

<p>Could any one have seen the carved head, just then,
it would have seemed to be exulting over its power, and
what its power had accomplished.</p>

<p>Heavier and heavier came the breathing of the sleepers,
and thicker and thicker grew the odor in the room.</p>

<p>It seemed certain that death must overtake the three
who were under the head's evil influence.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a black shape bounded into the embrasure
of the window. It was the monkey, and the
monkey was still playing with Carl's cap.</p>

<p>Standing on all four paws in the embrasure, the
monkey danced up and down and surveyed the scene below
him. He seemed to wonder at the silence of the
figures sprawled on the floor.</p>

<p>His simian senses were attracted by the gleaming eyes
of Obboney, and he began to chatter; in another moment
he had leaped into the room, bounded to the heap of
sawdust and picked up the head.</p>

<p>Then, like a thief fearing detection, he bounded chattering
back to the window, dropping the cap and clinging
with both his forepaws to the head.</p>

<p>In the space of a breath, he was out of the room and
upon the gallery.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ON THE TRAIL.</p>


<p>It looked as though Bangs, in carrying out his plot to
secure the chest, had overreached himself in one important
particular. The expressman he hired to carry the
iron chest to the house in St. Peters Street had a stand
near the railroad station, close to the levee, and it was
here that Matt and Dick found him.</p>

<p>Prudence in carrying out his treachery should have
made Bangs wary about hiring an expressman who could
be found so easily. However, Bangs had probably but
little time to spare, and no doubt he expected to be away
from the St. Peters Street house before any one could
suspect what he was up to and follow him there.</p>

<p>"You're the fellow who came to Stuyvesant Dock about
half-past ten this morning and took away an iron chest,
aren't you?" inquired Dick, facing the expressman.</p>

<p>"Ah reckons you-all's got de wrong pig by de ear,
boss," said the darky. "Ah didn't tote no iron chest fo'
nobody."</p>

<p>"Stow it!" cried Dick, looking at the man keenly.
"You're the swab, all right."</p>

<p>"Positive of it, Dick?" put in Matt.</p>

<p>"I'd take my solemn Alfred he's the man!"</p>

<p>"Then," went on Matt, quietly, "Bangs has probably
paid him something to keep still! I'll watch him, Dick,
while you go and get a policeman."</p>

<p>At that, the darky rolled up the whites of his eyes, and
showed other signs of trepidation.</p>

<p>"Hol' up dar, cap'n," he called to Dick, who had
started away. "Doan' go an' hurry off daterway. Mebby
Ah was de feller. What ob it?"</p>

<p>"Now you're talking sensibly," said Matt. "Do you
remember where you took the chest?"</p>

<p>"Ah doan jis' riccolect," the negro answered, scratching
his woolly head. "Ah wisht Ah did, sah, if it would
be any help t' yo, but mah mem'ry is dat sho't Ah done
kain't seem tuh remembah nuffin'."</p>

<p>This was so plainly a falsehood that Matt turned to
Dick.</p>

<p>"Go on after the officer, Dick," said he. "This fellow
don't intend to play fair with us. Perhaps we can
take him to jail and make him talk."</p>

<p>"Wait, dar!" cried the darky. "You-all is so quick
tuh go off an do somefin'. Yassuh, Ah reckons Ah kin
remembah de place. Hit was in Toulouse Street. Ah'll
take yo' dar if yo' wants tuh go."</p>

<p>"We'll go," answered Matt. "Get into the wagon,
Dick."</p>

<p>The darky drove over his former course, but instead
of keeping on to St. Peters he turned to the left at Toulouse,
and brought up before a building two blocks from
Royal.</p>

<p>"Dar's de bery place," said he, pointing to the building
with his stump of a whip.</p>

<p>Matt had one of his swift "hunches" that the darky
was still trying to fool them.</p>

<p>"You stay here with him, Dick," said he, starting to
get down from the wagon. "It won't take me long to
find out whether or not the chest is in that house. If it
isn't there, we'll know we haven't been brought to the
right place, and then we can call in the officer."</p>

<p>"Ah reckon yo' bettah sot right down ag'in, boss,"
said the expressman to Matt. "Dishyer ain't de place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Hit's on St. Peters Street, an' dis time I'll take yo' dar,
hones'. 'Clar tuh goodness, Ah nebber seen sich fellers
as you-all tuh stick an' hang. Now, den, we's
goin' tuh de right place."</p>

<p>He started up his mules again.</p>

<p>"You're going to run foul of a lot of trouble if you
keep trying to fool us," warned Dick.</p>

<p>"Ah ain't gwine tuh try hit no mo'," returned the
darky, earnestly.</p>

<p>"How much did Bangs give you to keep still about
that iron chest?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Bangs?" echoed the darky. "Whaffur yo' call him
Bangs, boss? Dat feller's name is Proctor."</p>

<p>"Well, Proctor, then. How much did he give you?"</p>

<p>"He done gib me five dollahs. Yo' ain't expectin' tuh
take hit away from me, is yo'?"</p>

<p>"If we find you're still trying to fool us," answered
Matt, severely, "we'll not only have the money taken
from you, but your license, as well."</p>

<p>"Ah's gwine tuh do de right thing now, boss," was
the earnest response. "You-all kin bank on dat."</p>

<p>A little later he stopped at the right place, and Matt
and Dick got down from the wagon. The praline
woman had repaired the damage Carl had caused her
stock in trade and was still in the doorway.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here, aunty?" Matt asked,
dropping a quarter in the negress' lap.</p>

<p>"All day, boss," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Did you see a man and a boy go in here with a big
iron box?"</p>

<p>"'Deed Ah did, sah!" said the woman, vehemently.
"De fat boy done slipped on de walk an' squashed down
en mah basket ob pralines. I was paid fo' dat, dough,
an' dey went on into de house."</p>

<p>"The trail's getting hot," spoke up Dick.</p>

<p>"Who lives in the house?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"M'sieu Rigolette."</p>

<p>Matt turned and pulled a bell at the door. After a
minute or two some one came out on an iron balcony
over the door and looked down. It was the creole gentleman,
still in his bare feet and wearing his tattered
trousers and flannel shirt. There was a wild, apprehensive
look in his face, and he would have withdrawn as
suddenly as he had appeared if Dick had not caught
sight of him and given a yell.</p>

<p>"Ahoy there, you!"</p>

<p>"Vat you vant?" came the query.</p>

<p>"Your name Rigolette?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>&mdash;yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"Come down here," said Matt. "We want to talk
with you."</p>

<p>"I haf done nozzing wrong," returned Rigolette, in a
whining, apologetic voice.</p>

<p>"We don't say you have," answered Matt, fully convinced
now that something unusual had taken place in
the house, "and all we want you to do is to come down
and talk with us."</p>

<p>The fellow disappeared from the balcony and presently
showed himself in the door.</p>

<p>"Vat eet ees?" he inquired.</p>

<p>There was fear in his shifty eyes as he flashed them
over Matt and Carl.</p>

<p>"Is there a man named Townsend in your house?"
returned Matt.</p>

<p>"<i>Non</i>&mdash;no. Zere ees no man lak dat.'</p>

<p>"A man named Jurgens, then?"</p>

<p>Rigolette started and hunched his shoulders.</p>

<p>"No, Jurgens ees not here, m'sieu."</p>

<p>"He's talking double, Matt," struck in Dick; "I can
see it in his eyes."</p>

<p>"Zere ees no sooch man," cried Rigollette, "<i>non</i>, I
swear eet!"</p>

<p>"Or Proctor?"</p>

<p>Rigolette quailed under Matt's steady look. The
creole, with a groan, flung out his hands.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>&mdash;yes," he murmured, "zey was here, <i>mais</i> not
no more. Zat ees ze trut'."</p>

<p>"Where are they? And where is the German boy who
came with Proctor? And the iron chest they brought
with them?"</p>

<p>"Zat ees ze puzzle&mdash;ze riddle, wat you call. Ze chest,
ah, ha, I show heem; <i>mais</i> ze boy, Proctair an' Jurgens,
zey haf gone. One by one zey go, run down ze stairs
lak ze wild man, zen t'roo de court and out ze door, and
away. Zey was cr-r-razy, an' zey keel ze P'tit Joujou!"
Rigolette wrung his hands. "Ze P'tit Joujou," he wailed.</p>

<p>"The more he talks," said Dick, "the less we know."</p>

<p>"Take us to the chest," ordered Matt, turning to the
creole.</p>

<p>"Zen <i>allons</i>!" returned the owner of the house. "I haf
done nozzing wrong, for I be ver' good Frenchmans,
creole Frenchmans," he called over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Something has happened, we can be jolly sure of that,
matey," remarked Dick, moving along at Matt's side.</p>

<p>"That's an easy guess, Dick," said Matt. "The question
is, what's happened?"</p>

<p>In the court the creole paused beside a black shape lying
on the ground. It was a monkey, and the monkey, as
could be seen at a glance, was dead. Its hairy arms were
embracing the head of Obboney, holding it in such a position
that the beady eyes stared upward into the faces of
the boys.</p>

<p>"Wow-whoosh!" gulped Dick, starting back. "Keelhaul
me if I ever saw anything like that before. Br-r-r!
It sends the cold shivers up and down my spine. What
do you make of it, Matt?"</p>

<p>Matt, an odd, uncanny feeling racing through him,
bent down and examined the head.</p>

<p>"It looks like the head of some heathen idol, Dick," he
replied. "What killed the monkey, Rigolette?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Zat I do not know, m'sieu," whimpered the creole.
"Ze poor P'tit Joujou!"</p>

<p>"I smell something that's powerful strong," observed
Dick, lifting his head and sniffing. "Don't you, mate?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Matt, "and it's something that makes me
dizzy. Where did that head come from, Rigolette?"</p>

<p>"Me, I do not know, m'sieu. Ze hor-r-rible head! Ou,
ai, I don't like zat to be here, but I plenty scare' to take
heem away from ze P'tit Joujou."</p>

<p>"Well," and Matt turned away, "where's the chest?
Take us to the chest, Rigolette."</p>

<p>The creole led the way to the stairs and up to the room
on the first balcony.</p>

<p>"Here ees w'ere zey breeng ze chest," said he, "an'
zere you see heem."</p>

<p>With the last words he stepped into the room and
pointed.</p>

<p>The chest, with the lid thrown back, lay to one side of
the room. Near it was the pile of sawdust. Dick, catching
sight of something near the heap of sawdust, stepped
forward and picked the object up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Carl's cap!" exclaimed Matt.</p>

<p>"Right-o!" returned Dick. "But why should the cap
be here and not Carl? We're in deep waters, matey.
Look at that raffle of cord on the floor. Some one's been
tied, here, and slipped the lashings. Sink me, but it must
have been Carl!"</p>

<p>Matt whirled on the creole.</p>

<p>"Did Proctor and Jurgens make the boy a prisoner?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"I know nozzing, m'sieu," replied the creole; "I haf
done nozzing wrong."</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just at that moment a door opened&mdash;a door opposite
the one leading upon the gallery that overlooked the
court.</p>

<p>"Bangs!" shouted Dick, pointing to a wild figure that
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>With a snarl like that of an angry panther, the figure
turned and leaped for an open window. Matt and Dick
both sprang in pursuit.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A BLACK MYSTERY.</p>


<p>Bangs, it seemed clear, had entered the other room
through a window in the side of the house. The roof of
a one-story building came close up under the window, so
that it was comparatively easy to enter Rigolette's house
in that manner.</p>

<p>And Bangs was trying to make his escape in the same
way he had come. He jumped from the window to the
neighboring rooftop and started for the edge of the
roof.</p>

<p>Matt and Dick, however, were upon him before he
could get over the roof's edge and drop to the ground.</p>

<p>Bangs fought fiercely, clawing and growling, like a
wild animal. His eyes were wild, he was bareheaded and
his hair was tumbled over his forehead.</p>

<p>"The man's crazy," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Is it drink did it?" asked Dick. "Has he been topping
the boom too much?"</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't drink; it's something else. Let's get
him back to Rigolette's and see if he's able to give us
any information."</p>

<p>Getting the squirming Bangs back to the creole's was
not an easy matter. However, Rigolette dropped the
pieces of rope lying in the room where Carl had been
confined, from the window, and the boys made their captive's
wrists and ankles secure; then they heaved Bangs
upward, and the creole caught him by the shoulders and
dragged him through the opening.</p>

<p>"He ees wild," chattered Rigolette; "ever'body ees
wild. I was wild myself."</p>

<p>"I say, Bangs!" called Dick, kneeling beside the prisoner
and shaking him. "What's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>Bangs mumbled incoherently and stared fiercely.</p>

<p>"Do you think he's putting it on, mate?" said Dick, appealing
to Matt.</p>

<p>"No, he's not putting it on. The man's really daft."
Matt turned to Rigolette. "You say the boy and Jurgens
were like Bangs, here?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>&mdash;yes," said the creole. "Zey run from ze house;
now Proctair, he ees come back by ze roof. W'y he do
zat w'en he could come by ze door? Zat ees a mystery."</p>

<p>"Aye, a black mystery!" cried Dick.</p>

<p>"Carl was certainly here," mused Matt; "the finding of
his cap proves it. And it's almost equally clear that he
was a prisoner. Something locoed him, as well as Bangs
and Jurgens; and Carl, in some manner, got out of his
ropes. Where is he now? That's the point. And the
iron chest&mdash;was that all that was in it?" and Matt nodded
toward the heap of sawdust.</p>

<p>At that moment the scrap of paper, which Jurgens had
dropped, met his eyes. He picked it up.</p>

<p>"What is it, mate?" asked Dick, anxiously. "Does it
shed any light?"</p>

<p>Matt read the paper aloud.</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky!" exclaimed Dick. "That head&mdash;it
must have been in the box. Wasn't there anything
else?"</p>

<p>Matt dropped to his knees excitedly and began running
his fingers through the sawdust.</p>

<p>"That was all," said he, "the head of Obboney and
this paper."</p>

<p>Dick laughed harshly.</p>

<p>"And that's the treasure Jurgens and Whistler have
been hunting for!" he exclaimed. "The head of an idol&mdash;a
heathen idol! I wonder what Townsend will say
to this? The Man from Cape Town seems to have pulled
the wool over the eyes of everybody."</p>

<p>"Why didn't Jurgens take the head away with him if
it was in the box?" Matt queried, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Probably he didn't think it was worth bothering with;
either that or else he was too crazy to think of it."</p>

<p>"Go down and get the head, Dick," said Matt. "We
might as well put it back in the chest and try and deliver
everything to Townsend just as we found it."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," answered Dick, and started.</p>

<p>Matt was astounded by the situation which confronted
him and Dick in the creole's house. Bangs had engineered
a piece of successful treachery, but, in the end,
the treachery had somehow turned against him and Jurgens.
What had caused the death of the monkey? And
what was it that had turned the brains of Bangs, Jurgens
and Carl? Bangs was clearly demented, and if
Rigolette was to be believed, so were Jurgens and Carl.</p>

<p>And only that idol's head had been in the iron chest!
Yes, truly, the affair was a mystery&mdash;and a black one.</p>

<p>While Matt was struggling to think of something that
might help to a solution of the problem, Dick came
bounding up the stairs and along the gallery.</p>

<p>"It's gone!" he panted.</p>

<p>Matt whirled on him in consternation.</p>

<p>"What, the head of Obboney?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing else, old ship! It's not where we saw it
and it isn't anywhere in the court. The negro woman
at the door says that a man answering Jurgens' description
rushed into the house and out again. He had something
when he went out, but she couldn't see what it
was. I'll bet it was that idol's head, mate!"</p>

<p>"It must have been!" exclaimed Matt. "Perhaps a
little reason returned to Jurgens and he came back after
the head. Did he seem to be crazy, or in any manner off
his balance?"</p>

<p>"The woman says he looked wild, didn't say a word
and went like a streak."</p>

<p>"Well," said Matt, regretfully, "we've been beaten out,
after all. What we've got to do now is to find Carl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where'll we look for him? We can go cruising
around, but this is a big town and, if Carl is off his bearings,
there's no telling where he'll go."</p>

<p>"If he's very much off his bearings, the police will
pick him up. And the same with Jurgens. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt halted and gave a glance at Rigolette, who was
leaning moodily against the wall.</p>

<p>"Come over here, Dick," said Matt, stepping to one
side. When his chum joined him, he lowered his voice
so the creole could not hear what was said.</p>

<p>"You remember that smoke picture of Yamousa's&mdash;the
one you and I saw?"</p>

<p>"Dowse me, mate, if I could ever forget that!"</p>

<p>"What do you think of Yamousa and her smoke pictures,
by now?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm not much of a hand to believe in things
like that," replied Dick, slowly, "but that first smoke
picture, showing the boat and the chest, with the <i>Hawk</i>
overhead and you below&mdash;why, that was a dead ringer
for what happened. Blow me tight! I'm fair dazed to
account for that picture."</p>

<p>"So am I," continued Matt, earnestly, "but this is what
I'm trying to get at. If one picture gave a truthful forecast
of what was to happen, isn't it possible that the
second picture was equally truthful and to be depended
on?"</p>

<p>"More than possible, Matt&mdash;<i>probable</i>."</p>

<p>"Do you recollect what that second picture was?</p>

<p>"Why, a room with stone walls and a man who looked
like Townsend lashed by the hands and feet and lying on
the floor!"</p>

<p>"Then, if you remember, we saw the outside of the
building&mdash;or what Yamousa said was the outside of it&mdash;And
the lower story was occupied by an antique shop."</p>

<p>"Right-o! The sign above the shop bore the name of
Crenelette."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Now, Dick, it strikes me we ought to go
down Royal Street and look for Crenelette's place of
business. There's nothing we can do for Carl, just now,
inasmuch as we don't know where to go to find him, and
there may be something we <i>can</i> do for Townsend."</p>

<p>"Your head's level, matey, like it always is. We'll go
on a hunt for Townsend. If the contents of the iron
chest can't be recovered, we must do the next best thing
and help Townsend out of a hole&mdash;provided he <i>is</i> in a
hole, which seems almost certain."</p>

<p>Matt turned away and addressed himself to Rigolette.</p>

<p>"How long was Jurgens here, in your house, Rigolette?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Two&mdash;t'ree day, m'sieu."</p>

<p>"What was he doing here?"</p>

<p>"Zat I do not know. <i>Sapristi!</i> My head ees buzzing
wit' all dese zings vat I don't onderstan'."</p>

<p>"You may not have been doing anything wrong, of
your own knowledge, by harboring and helping Jurgens
and Proctor, Rigolette, but those men are criminals,
and you've got to walk pretty straight from this on if
you don't want to get yourself into trouble."</p>

<p>"I no want ze trouble, m'sieu!" whined the creole.
"I have ze trouble enough wizout making more."</p>

<p>"Then keep Proctor here, just as he is. He may come
to himself, before long, and when he does we'll try to
get back and have a talk with him. Comprenny?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui</i>&mdash;yes. He ees my friend, but I keep heem lak
you say. Zen, bumby, eet may be he can tell what keel
ze P'tit Joujou."</p>

<p>"I haven't any doubt but that he can let in a good deal
of light upon the mystery. We'll try and return here,
in a few hours. Meanwhile, if the Dutch boy wanders
back, try and keep him."</p>

<p>"I do w'at I can, m'sieu."</p>

<p>Matt and Dick, puzzled and bewildered but hoping for
results from their fresh line of inquiry, inquired their
way to Royal Street and turned along it in the direction
of Canal.</p>

<p>Fortune favored them, for they had not gone a block
along Royal Street before they saw an antique shop
with the sign, "M. Crenelette, Antiques," over the door.</p>

<p>Matt and Dick went to the other side of the street
and took in the appearance of the building. In every
particular it conformed to the smoke picture which they
had seen, miles away, in the hut of Yamousa.</p>

<p>"I'm all ahoo!" admitted Dick. "Yamousa must know
a whole lot of things that scientists haven't yet discovered.
That's the building, to a dot!"</p>

<p>"It's amazing!" murmured Matt. "Our cue seems to
be a good one and it's up to us to follow it and see
where it leads."</p>

<p>"Right-o! Heave ahead and I'll tow along, ready for
anything that happens."</p>

<p>As the boys pushed across the street toward the door
of the antique shop, a face dodged away from a second-story
window. And it was a face which, if the boys
had seen it, would have warned them to be on their
guard.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AT CLOSE QUARTERS.</p>


<p>M. Crenelette was a gray-haired, benevolent looking
man with mild blue eyes. It was impossible to associate
him with anything in the nature of lawlessness, and the
boys were tempted to think they were on the wrong
track.</p>

<p>M. Crenelette was French, but he talked English like
one to the manner born.</p>

<p>His establishment was a veritable junk shop.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, my friends?" he asked, getting
up from a desk where he had been writing.</p>

<p>"Have you any objections to letting us take a look
through your basement?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Basement? basement?" repeated the antiquarian, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes, through the cellar under your store."</p>

<p>"My dear young man, there are no cellars in New
Orleans. The ground is too low, and there is water too
near the surface."</p>

<p>Once more Matt and Dick began to feel that they
were making a mistake in coming to M. Crenelette.</p>

<p>"Is there a room in this building that is inclosed with
stone walls?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" and M. Crenelette's face brightened, "you speak
now of the vaults of the old bank. They are on the
second floor. I do not use the second floor, and it was
rented, a few days ago, to an American gentleman. He
has not moved in, yet. What interests you in the old
vault?"</p>

<p>"We simply want to look it over," Matt answered.
"Will you show us how to get up there? If the man
who rented the place hasn't moved in yet I suppose there
won't be any objection?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly not. Come this way."</p>

<p>The Frenchman passed out the rear of his store and
pointed to an open back stairway.</p>

<p>"The door may be locked," said he, "and, in that case,
you will be disappointed, for I have given the key to the
new tenant. You might go up the stairs and try the
door."</p>

<p>As Matt and Dick ascended the stairs, M. Crenelette
posted himself to watch. The bell at his front door
suddenly tinkled, however, announcing a customer, and
he had to go away.</p>

<p>The boys tried the door and found it open.</p>

<p>"The new tenant," remarked Dick, "isn't a very careful
man. I wonder if his name is Jurgens?"</p>

<p>"Probably," said Matt, stepping into the room beyond
the door.</p>

<p>It was a small room, and there was another door opposite
the one by which he had entered.</p>

<p>"Dowse my toplights!" exclaimed Dick. "This doesn't
look much like a bank. And then the idea of a bank
being on the second floor! All my eye and Betty Martin!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the bank was on the first floor and the vaults
on the second," suggested Matt. "It was probably an
old institution. From the looks of this building it must
have been standing at the time Jackson whipped the
Britishers."</p>

<p>"I'm a Britisher, you know, old ship," laughed Dick,
"and I don't like to have you rub that Jackson fight into
me. Push ahead and let's see what's in the next room."</p>

<p>Matt opened the door and was confronted by a windowless
room as dark as Egypt. The only daylight that
reached it came from the room in which the two boys
were standing.</p>

<p>"Shiver me!" muttered Dick. "I guess we've reached
the vaults, matey."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't have a door like this to a bank vault,
Dick. We'll go in and see if there isn't a door on the
other side that we can open."</p>

<p>Matt entered the room, groping his way through the
thick gloom. Dick followed him closely.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the door through which they had just come
slammed shut and a key was heard grating in the lock.</p>

<p>"Trapped!" muttered Dick. "There was some one
here and laying for us."</p>

<p>"Quick!" called Matt, whirling around. "Try the
door."</p>

<p>Before Dick could get back to it, Matt heard a muttered
exclamation and the sound of a struggle. It was
impossible to see a thing, and the young motorist could
only guess at what had happened.</p>

<p>"Dick!" he called, leaping forward.</p>

<p>"Look alive, mate!" panted Dick. "Some one's got
hold of me."</p>

<p>Before Dick had fairly finished speaking, a pair of
stout arms went around Matt, and he was forced to fight
on his own account and leave Dick to look after himself.</p>

<p>It was a struggle at close quarters, and a very unequal
one. Slowly but steadily Matt was forced across the
floor.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he panted. "What are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whistler!" came a husky voice, "I'm closer to you,
now, than I was at the bayou. Saw you coming across
the street and opened the door to make it easy for you
to get in. I don't know how you found out about this
place, but your call here won't do you any good. You've
bothered Jurgens and me as long as you're going to, and
you and Ferral will never live to get away from this
building!"</p>

<p>With that, Matt felt himself hurled roughly backward.
He struck against a wall and dropped half stunned to
the floor.</p>

<p>The next moment Dick came banging against him, and
there followed the clang of an iron door, the rattle of a
key, then silence.</p>

<p>"Matt?" called Dick, his voice echoing and reëchoing
strangely.</p>

<p>"Here," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"Blest if we smoked Whistler's roll quick enough! We
came easy for him&mdash;so easy that I'm ashamed of myself.
The fact that he was here proves that this is a
sort of headquarters for him and Jurgens."</p>

<p>"If this wasn't a rendezvous of theirs, of course Whistler
wouldn't have been around."</p>

<p>"Where are we?"</p>

<p>"I guess," answered Motor Matt, slowly, "that we
have found the old vault. That was an iron door that
closed on us, if the noise it made counts for anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, glory!" grunted Dick, disgustedly. "How long
can we stay in here without smothering to death?"</p>

<p>"The air seems to be fairly pure, at present&mdash;purer, in
fact, than it was out in that other room. But, Whistler!
Why he was the last man I was expecting to see."</p>

<p>"And we didn't see much of him, at that," growled
Dick. "My eye, but here's a go! Whistler didn't lose
much time coming in from that bayou. I wonder if
he's found Jurgens, and if the two of them have got the
hooks on Carl?"</p>

<p>"There are a whole lot of things I wish I knew, Dick,"
said Matt.</p>

<p>"Same here, matey. Whistler had some one with him,
and that other man may have been Jurgens."</p>

<p>"Well, if it was Jurgens, then it's a cinch Jurgens
wasn't so much off his balance as Rigolette led us to
believe. But I don't think it was Jurgens."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Jurgens would have said something to let us know
that he had a hand in our capture."</p>

<p>"Right-o. Jurgens is a good deal of a boaster and
likes to run up his signals whenever he gets the chance.
We've had a nice time of it since we reached New
Orleans, I must say! With you and me locked up, and
Carl running around with his mind in a haze, I wonder
what's going to become of the <i>Hawk</i>? She can't roost
out there on the dock indefinitely."</p>

<p>"We're not going to stay locked up for long," returned
Matt. "Just as soon as we catch our breath
we've got to take a look around here and see if we can't
get away."</p>

<p>"With an iron door to batter down, matey, the outlook
isn't what you might call promising. I've heard of
men being shut up in bank vaults, but they usually
smothered. Oh, hang the luck! And hang the way we
dropped into this bunch of trouble! We ought to have
suspected there was some one in here when we found the
door open."</p>

<p>"No use crying over spilt milk, Dick. Don't you think
it might have been Whistler instead of Jurgens who
rushed into the house of Rigolette's and took the idol's
head away from Joujou?"</p>

<p>"One guess is as good as another," said Dick, heavily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we'll stop guessing and try and get down to
facts. Have you any matches?"</p>

<p>"A pocketful."</p>

<p>"Then strike one and we'll find out where we are."</p>

<p>The floor of the room was of brick. Dick scratched a
match on the floor and then got to his feet and held
the light in the best position for him and Matt to make
a survey of their quarters.</p>

<p>The room in which the boys found themselves was
about ten feet square. The walls and ceiling were of
stone, and there was only one opening, and this was
closed with a heavy iron door.</p>

<p>Dick stepped to the door and pushed against it. Although
rust encrusted the iron plates, yet the door rigidly
resisted his push upon it.</p>

<p>"We might blow the door down with a stick of dynamite,"
said Dick, "but that's the only way we could do
the trick, mate. I'm a Fiji if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look!" came hoarsely from Matt; "on the floor,
there, off to the left of you!"</p>

<p>The flame of the match was eating close to Dick's fingers,
but in the last, dying glow he swerved his eyes in
the direction indicated by Matt, and an astonishing duplicate
of Yamousa's second smoke picture burst on his
eyes.</p>

<p>On the brick floor lay a man with gray hair and gray
mustache, bound hand and foot and gagged.</p>

<p>It seemed to Matt and Dick as though they were again
in the hut by the bayou and peering into the smoke
arising from the earthen jar under the spell of Yamousa.</p>

<p>"Townsend!" gasped Dick.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THREE IN A TRAP.</p>


<p>The boys knew Archibald Townsend, otherwise Captain
Nemo, Jr., of the <i>Grampus</i>, well. The matchlight
was feeble, but there could be no mistake.</p>

<p>Both of them crept forward, and while Dick groped
about with his hands to unloosen the cords that bound
the prisoner, Matt removed the gag.</p>

<p>"King!" gasped Townsend, as soon as he could speak;
"and Ferral! This is the most amazing thing I ever
heard of! How is it you happen to be here?"</p>

<p>"That will be even more amazing, Townsend," answered
Matt, "when we tell you about it. How long
have you been here?"</p>

<p>"It must be all of two days, although there's no telling
the difference between night and day in such a black
hole. Gad, but it's good to see you boys again. When
did you get here?"</p>

<p>"To-day," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"And it's been our busy day, too," added Dick.
"We've been on the jump ever since we struck the
town."</p>

<p>"I was so astounded when you boys were thrown in
here that I could hardly think," continued Townsend.
"Later, when you began to talk, what you said aroused
my curiosity. You got my telegram, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and started at once as soon as it came to hand."</p>

<p>"What happened to you? I might as well tell you,
before you begin to talk, though, that Jurgens has got
the iron chest away from me again."</p>

<p>"We know that," said Matt, "for we picked it up out
of an empty boat in the river."</p>

<p>An exclamation of astonishment burst from Townsend.</p>

<p>"Start at once," said he, "and give me the whole of
your experiences. After that I'll tell you what happened
to me, and we'll have a fair understanding of the
situation."</p>

<p>Matt and Dick, between them, related their adventures,
beginning at Bayou Yamousa. Townsend was absorbed
in the recital, but made no comment until the
last word was spoken.</p>

<p>"Mystery seems to have been following mystery!" he
exclaimed. "The Obeah woman has helped you, and
me, in a most remarkable way. I am not particularly
credulous, and that talk of yours about the smoke
pictures, coming from any one else but you, would be
hard to swallow. Most remarkable&mdash;in fact, astounding!
By some arts of her own she seems to have thrown into
the screen of smoke events that were to happen, as well
as to give you a view of my situation, many miles away&mdash;a
view that was complete in every particular.</p>

<p>"All that is strange and incomprehensible, but it is
hardly a marker to the rest that happened. The head of
an idol in that iron chest! I wonder if it had anything
to do with the unbalancing of Jurgens, Bangs and Carl?
Furthermore, I wonder how it happened that Bangs was
on the levee to spring that cock-and-bull story on you
when you arrived? These are all inexplicable things
to me."</p>

<p>Townsend fell silent, apparently musing in the blank
gloom.</p>

<p>"You are probably anxious to hear how I lost the
chest a second time," he presently went on. "It happened
principally because I was ignorant of the fact that
our old enemies, Jurgens and Whistler, were in New
Orleans. I had not heard a thing about them since they
vanished so mysteriously from that little island in the Bahamas.</p>

<p>"As soon as the <i>Grampus</i> reached this port, I immediately
laid my plans to have the iron chest removed
to a place of safety. It was night, and I hired a man
with a wheelbarrow to take it into town. I went with
the man, but, before I left the <i>Grampus</i>, I arranged with
Cassidy to send you a telegram on the following day.
It was not my intention to return to the <i>Grampus</i> that
night, and I expected to be busy locating the lady for
whom the Man from Cape Town had asked me to look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"While we were crossing the levee, and were in a
dark and obscure place on the water front, I and the
man with the wheelbarrow were set upon by a gang of
roughs. The man who was wheeling the chest was
knocked down and left unconscious, and I was bound,
put in a closed carriage and brought here. Since that
time my mind and body have both been shrouded in
total darkness. Twice a day a negro has come and given
me food, but I have seen nothing of either Whistler or
Jurgens.</p>

<p>"However, I surmised the reason for my capture and
detention in this place. My scoundrelly enemies wished
to keep me in limbo until they had divided the treasure
in the iron chest and got well away with their booty.
Yet the time I spent here has not been altogether lost.
I have cultivated my negro jailer. He would tell me
nothing about my captors, nor why I had been captured,
but he has promised to release me if I would give him
$500. The last time he came with food I wrote a line
to Cassidy telling him to pay over the money and ask
no questions. The negro may get the money and then
fail to carry out his part of the contract&mdash;but it was
a chance I had to take."</p>

<p>"Isn't there any other way to get out of here except
by the negro's aid?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"I have had little else to do, while lying here, but
turn such expedients over and over in my mind. I believe
there is a way, Matt, providing we were armed
with a crowbar. You will notice that the air in here is
pure and wholesome&mdash;something you would not find in
an air-tight vault."</p>

<p>"Matt noticed that, Townsend," returned Dick, "as
soon as we landed in here."</p>

<p>"Well," pursued Townsend, "light another match, Ferral,
and then watch the flame."</p>

<p>The match was lighted, held about a foot from the
floor, and the flame was seen to be sucked sideways and
downward, as though by a draught of air.</p>

<p>"There's a current of fresh air blowing through here,"
observed Matt.</p>

<p>"I noticed that the first time the negro brought my
food to me," said Townsend. "He had a candle, and
the flame of the candle, like that of the match, inclined
downward and burned with a hissing sound as though
fanned by a draught of air. I managed to roll about
and investigate a little, tapping with my heels on the
brick. There are crevices in the brick, over near the
end of the vault, and I am sure that a little work with
a crowbar would bring us either into the outside air, or
into the shop below. But," and Townsend gave a grim
laugh, "we have no crowbar; and, at the time I made
my discoveries, I did not even have the use of my limbs."</p>

<p>"I've got a dirk, old ship," said Dick. "Give me
time enough and I could dig through a stone wall with
it."</p>

<p>"It will be just as well to wait until night," answered
Townsend. "The man in the store below might hear
us and he may be in league with Jurgens and Whistler."</p>

<p>"He's not," averred Matt, "I'll answer for that. If
there was ever an honest Frenchman, he's one."</p>

<p>"But he's letting Jurgens and Whistler use this floor
for lawless purposes."</p>

<p>"He doesn't know what they're using it for. In fact,
he doesn't think they've moved in here yet."</p>

<p>"Then we might go ahead with our work," said
Townsend. "Can you work in the dark, Ferral?"</p>

<p>"If I have to, aye, aye," answered Dick; "and it looks
as though I'd have to, considering that the only light
we have is furnished by matches."</p>

<p>"Well, start in. You can tell where the place is by
the cool air along the floor. It will be a long job, and
Matt and I will relieve you from time to time."</p>

<p>Dick lost not a moment in getting to work.</p>

<p>"The chances are, Townsend," observed Matt, "your
negro will never have the opportunity to get into this
vault again. Whistler has been away and has come
back. He will take the vault key and act as jailer, if
I'm any prophet."</p>

<p>"From what Whistler said when he and his man threw
us in here," spoke up Dick, "it's my idea that he intends
to leave us here to starve. He wouldn't be above that
sort of thing."</p>

<p>"He and Jurgens," said Townsend gravely, "wouldn't
be above anything. This is a rare opportunity to get all
of us out of the way&mdash;too good an opportunity, I'm
afraid they'll think, to be allowed to pass. We'd better
depend upon our own efforts, and dig out as quick as we
can. We'll have to be quick, too, before hunger and
thirst get the better of us."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea, Townsend," asked Matt, "why
that Man from Cape Town should put an idol's head
in that iron chest?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest," declared Townsend. "I can't
believe it possible that he is trying to hoax anybody.
We must not lose sight of the fact that the lady I am to
look for, in this city, he claimed to be his daughter. I
was to find her, you may perhaps remember, open the
chest in her presence and divide the contents of the
chest equally. It would be difficult for us to divide an
idol's head, and there would be small gain for us, even if
we did it. No, no, boys, there is something more back
of this&mdash;another mystery among the many that have
already put us at sea."</p>

<p>"Something must have turned the brains of Jurgens,
Bangs and Carl," remarked Matt, "and that could not
have happened until the chest had been opened. Could
you make a guess as to what it was, Townsend?"</p>

<p>"Guesses are easy&mdash;but profitless. Bangs, you say, is
a prisoner. If he recovers his wits, perhaps he will tell
us what we want to know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"That creole in St. Peters Street," put in Dick, "may
not hang onto Bangs if we don't show up at the house
to-night. We told him we'd come, but he may think
we've slanted away for good and let Bangs go. He told
us Bangs was a messmate of his."</p>

<p>"Well," suggested Townsend, "there's Carl. He'll be
able to tell us something when he comes to himself and
finds you again. If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There came a snap as of broken metal from Dick's end
of the vault, followed by a muttered exclamation.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Ferral?" asked Townsend.</p>

<p>"I've broken my dirk short off at the hilt!" growled
Dick. "Keelhaul me for a bungler! <i>Now</i> what are we
going to do? We haven't even a knife to work with."</p>

<p>A pall of dejection settled over the three in the stone
and iron trap. Each, perhaps, was casting vainly about
in his mind for some expedient which could help them
to their freedom.</p>

<p>Before any of them could speak, there came from the
door a sound as of some one trying to push a key into
the lock.</p>

<p>"Whistler!" whispered Matt.</p>

<p>"He'd not come here alone, mate," said Dick, "knowing
that two of us are free and that we have surely released
Townsend. If it's Whistler, you can lay something
handsome he has a gang at his heels."</p>

<p>"No matter if he has," spoke up Townsend, "it's a
chance to fight our way out of this dungeon. Group
yourselves about the door and, when it opens, spring out
and do what you can with your fists."</p>

<p>The suggestion captured the instant approval of Matt
and Dick. All three of the prisoners huddled close to
the door, and when the key grated, and the door was
pulled ajar, they all sprang out.</p>

<p>Contrary to their expectations they met with no resistance.
A negro with a candle had unlocked the door, and
he was nearly overturned by the concerted rush of the
prisoners.</p>

<p>"Why," cried Townsend, "it's the man who has been
bringing my meals."</p>

<p>"Great spark plugs!" exclaimed Matt, "we know him,
too. He's the fellow that hauled Bangs, Carl and the
iron chest to the house in St. Peters Street!"</p>

<p>"Well met, old ship!" jubilated Dick. "We can forgive
you a whole lot for this."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AN ASTOUNDING SITUATION.</p>


<p>From his appearance, the expressman was not feeling
at all easy in his mind. His knees were knocking together,
the candle was shaking in his hand, his teeth
were chattering, his eyes were rolling frenziedly, and a
grayish pallor had overspread his black face.</p>

<p>"Ah's got de feelin' dat Ah's er gone niggah," he
mumbled. "Da's right, cap'n. Ah's done seen t'ings, dis
ebenin', dat Ah ain't nevah gwine tuh git ober."</p>

<p>"You got the five hundred?" asked Townsend.</p>

<p>"Sho'ly, sho'ly. En Ah's er hones' niggah er Ah'd
nevah come hyeh afteh what Ah seen."</p>

<p>"Did you have the key?"</p>

<p>"Whistler got de key away f'om me, along endurin'
de aftehnoon, cap'n; but I come hyeh en Ah&mdash;Ah done
got it back, but Ah mos' died a-doin' it. Oh, by golly,
hit's de wustest t'ing Ah evah did!"</p>

<p>"You didn't have to kill Whistler to get the key, did
you?" went on Townsend, startled by the darky's
fright.</p>

<p>"No, no, boss, Ah ain't dat kind."</p>

<p>"Where's Whistler?"</p>

<p>"He's heah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here!"</p>

<p>"Da's whut! En Jurgens is heah, en anudder white
man&mdash;dey's all heah."</p>

<p>"Where are they? What are they doing? Can't they
overhear us?"</p>

<p>Townsend fired his questions like the reports of a Gatling,
meanwhile looking about him as though to fight
whatever peril might show itself.</p>

<p>"You ain't got tuh feah dem no mo', cap'n," went on
the darky. "Ah took de key f'om Whistler, en he didn't
stop me&mdash;he wasn't able. I's feelin' monsus out ob sorts
wif mahse'f, en now dat Ah's let you-all loose, Ah's
gwine tuh cl'ar out. Take de candle if you want tuh
stay heah, but Ah's gwine."</p>

<p>The darky forced the candle into Townsend's hand
and whirled away.</p>

<p>"Hold up!" cried Townsend. "Don't be in such a
rush. Tell us what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the negro was gone, clattering across the floor of
an outer room and rushing down the outside stairs.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose put him in that kind of a
taking, mates?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"It puzzles me," answered Townsend.</p>

<p>"Suppose we look around," said Matt.</p>

<p>They were in the dark room in which Matt and Dick
had had their short struggle at close quarters with
Whistler and his man. Dick opened the door on the
right. It led into the room that opened upon the outside
stairs. The door at the head of the stairs was ajar, and
the released prisoners could see that dusk had fallen outdoors.</p>

<p>"Nothing in this direction, mates," announced Dick.
"Try that other door next to you, Matt."</p>

<p>Matt opened the door, and instantly a peculiar odor
was perceptible.</p>

<p>"We've sniffed that before, Matt," said Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"I remember it," returned Matt; "it was in the court
of Rigolette's house. I wonder what it can be, and how
we are able to smell it here?"</p>

<p>Shielding the flaring candle with his hand, Matt
stepped into the other room. In doing so he stumbled
against something on the floor and stooped downward.</p>

<p>It was the form of Jurgens!</p>

<p>As Matt recoiled, startled cries came from Townsend
and Dick.</p>

<p>"Three of 'em, or I'm a Hottentot!" exclaimed Dick.
"Look, will you! And there's the head of Obboney!"</p>

<p>Dick's report was literally true. Lying sprawled about
the floor, breathing heavily, was not only Jurgens, but
Whistler and one other man, as well. They lay around
the idol's head, and the head, face upward, offered a
most diabolical spectacle in the candlelight.</p>

<p>The beady eyes gleamed and glittered, and the distorted
face took on an expression it had not held in the
broad light of day.</p>

<p>"Most remarkable!" murmured Townsend, stepping
over the form of Jurgens and picking up the head.
"What a monstrous thing!" he added, shuddering as he
held the head up and looked into its face. "What heathen
mind was ever able to conjure that out of a block of
wood? The arch fiend himself must have had a hand in
the work."</p>

<p>"But how do you account for all this layout?" queried
Dick, waving his hand at the forms on the floor.</p>

<p>"Jurgens, after he took the head from the court of
Rigolette's house," surmised Matt, "must finally have
reached here with it. He arrived after you and I were
thrown into the vault, Dick, and that unknown man, lying
near Whistler, must have been the one who helped
put us into the stone chamber. Jurgens, Whistler and
the other man came into this room, and in due course
they fell under the baneful spell of Obboney. I don't
know what else to call it."</p>

<p>"That's the way of it, Matt," said Townsend; "that
must have been the way of it. When the negro came
here, he found these men sprawled out, just as we see
them now. Negroes as a rule are superstitious, and you
can understand what a tremendous effort it must have
taken for that darky to step across Jurgens, pass this
head and take the key of the vault from Whistler's
pocket! No wonder the fellow was half scared to death!
It speaks pretty well for him that he dared to do what
he did and earn the five hundred I asked Cassidy to give
him."</p>

<p>"A main fine thing for us," remarked Dick, "that he
had nerve enough for the job."</p>

<p>"There must be something about this head that is valuable,"
muttered Townsend. "It would not have been
in that chest if it wasn't valuable. Still, I can't understand
why the Man from Cape Town should want the
chest opened and the idol's head revealed before a
woman. Why, this thing is enough to send a woman
into hysterics."</p>

<p>"He had a scheme," said Dick, "but shiver me if I
can fathom it."</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to feel a bit queer in the head," spoke
up Matt. "I wonder if I only imagine it?"</p>

<p>"No imagination about it, matey," declared Dick. "I'm
feeling some queer myself."</p>

<p>"I don't see why we should," said Townsend. "What
is there about this head to exert such an evil influence?"</p>

<p>"There must be something," returned Matt, "to stretch
out fellows like Whistler and Jurgens as we see them."</p>

<p>"Whoosh!" exclaimed Dick. "Hear 'em breathe!
Their breath seems to be coming harder and harder. I
wonder if that odor could kill a man?"</p>

<p>"It must have killed the monkey," said Matt. "If it
would kill an animal in that way, I don't see why it
wouldn't kill a man."</p>

<p>"Have you that paper that was found in the chest,
Matt?" asked Townsend.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Read it to me."</p>

<p>Matt drew the parchment from his pocket and stepped
closer to the candle which, a few moments before, he
had handed to Dick.</p>

<p>Then, while he read the written words, Townsend kept
his keen, inquiring eyes on the idol's head.</p>

<p>"It may be," observed Townsend, when the reading
was finished, "that there is a hidden meaning in that
communication. The question is, what is that hidden
meaning? Does it deal with high finance, or thaumaturgy,
or any of the other arts, black or white, with
which princes of the black art are supposed to arm themselves?
Ha! Answer me, some of you."</p>

<p>Matt gave a jump and stared at Dick. Dick, also
startled, returned Matt's stare with interest.</p>

<p>Townsend was talking nonsense&mdash;and he was always
a grave, earnest man with no use whatever for anything
foolish or extravagant.</p>

<p>Was the deadly odor taking effect upon his brain?</p>

<p>Holding the head as Hamlet held the skull of Yorick,
Townsend struck an attitude.</p>

<p>"Alas, poor Yorick!" he began.</p>

<p>But he got no further.</p>

<p>Just at that moment some one bounded into the room,
snatched the head of Obboney from his hands and hurled
it against the wall.</p>

<p>There was a smash, a tinkling clatter as of pebbles
upon the floor, then silence.</p>

<p>"Ged oudt oof here! ged oudt or you vas all deadt
men! Helup me, Matt, to pull dose fellers on der floor

boy.</p>

<p>"You bed you," answered Carl. "Ged Downsent avay,

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE TREASURE.</p>


<p>Townsend was babbling Shakespeare as Dick grabbed
him and hauled him out to the room at the top of the
stairway. There, seated on the landing, with the cool
night air fanning his face and clearing his brain of the
deadly influence of the odor, he slowly regained his
poise.</p>

<p>Matt and Carl dragged Jurgens, Whistler and the
other man out of the fatal room, and Carl, the last to
leave, shut the door tightly.</p>

<p>A few minutes in the night air served to revive Carl,
Matt and Dick. Then, quite naturally the others wanted
to know what had happened to the Dutch boy, and where
he had been.</p>

<p>Carl related his experiences in the house of Rigolette,
holding his listeners spellbound with his recital.</p>

<p>"Afder I dumpled ofer," he went on, "I ditn't know

<p>Silence followed Carl's talk.</p>

<p>"Rigolette's monkey got the idol's head, Carl," said
Matt. "The animal must have crawled in through the
window that gave way under your weight, picked up the
head and scampered off with it."</p>

<p>"Hooray for der monkey!" said Carl. "If it hatn't
peen for him you vouldn't have a Dutch bard some more,
Matt und Jurgens und Pangs vould have peen some
goners, too."</p>

<p>"It seemed," said Townsend, with his usual gravity,
"as though I was somewhat affected by that head."</p>

<p>"Sink me if you weren't, Townsend," answered Dick.
"You were spouting Shakespeare and using words a
fathom long."</p>

<p>"I have no remembrance of that&mdash;only a hazy recollection
that I didn't know what I was doing. I presume the
idol was carved out of some kind of wood that has that
deadly odor, and that the mahogany sawdust in the iron
chest helped the head to retain the baneful influence.
But why should the Man from Cape Town pack the
deadly thing in the chest and then ask me to open the
chest in the presence of his daughter? There are features
of this case which it is difficult to reconcile with
the facts."</p>

<p>Matt started up suddenly.</p>

<p>"Did you break that idol's head, Carl, when you
smashed it against the wall?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Vell, I bed you!" answered Carl. "I made oop my
mindt dot I vould preak him indo a t'ousant bieces. Dot
von't shtop der shmell oof der vood, aber it vill shpoil
der headt, all righdt."</p>

<p>"We'll have to go back there," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Nod on your life!" cried Carl.</p>

<p>"We can't leave the fragments, for one thing," insisted
Matt, "because they would be a source of peril to
whoever found them and did not understand their power;
then, for another thing, I have just thought of something."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course we'll go back," said Townsend. "There
can't be any danger in going into the room for a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"Den," said Carl, "der fairst t'ing vat ve do vill be
to put der bieces oof der headt in my coat und tie dem
oop tight; und der next t'ing afder dot vill be to go to
der rifer und shake out der bieces indo der vater. Dot
vill be der lasdt oof Obboney."</p>

<p>"Good idea, Carl," approved Townsend. "Pull off
your coat and come on."</p>

<p>Dick had left the candle in the room where Jurgens,
Whistler and the other man were lying. The three men
were lying just as when Townsend and the boys had
left them, a short time before, but it was plain that their
breathing was becoming easier by slow degrees.</p>

<p>Matt picked up the candle and preceded his companions
into the front room.</p>

<p>The head of Obboney was not in a thousand pieces,
but it had been smashed utterly beyond repair. Carl
sprang forward, his coat in his hand, to pick up the
pieces and wrap them in the garment. Before he got
near the wall, however, he started back with a shout of
surprise.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cried; "see dere, vonce! Vot you call
dose t'ings?"</p>

<p>Matt held the candle nearer the floor, and the light
fell over little scattered objects that gleamed like dewdrops.
There were several handfuls of them, and in two
or three places they were heaped up in irridescent piles.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" gasped Townsend, starting forward and
dropping to his knees.</p>

<p>He picked up several of the glimmering objects and
examined them under the flame of the candle; then he
turned to the boys with an odd, exultant look and spoke
but one word:</p>

<p>"Diamonds!"</p>

<p>"Tiamonts?" echoed Carl.</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky!" muttered Dick.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say those are diamonds, Townsend?"
queried Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"Yes, and of the first water. They're South African
stones. There was quite a little method in the madness
of the Man from Cape Town, after all. Get the pieces
of the head in your coat, Carl, and put up a window,
Dick. We can't take any chances with these stones while
those fellows are in the next room."</p>

<p>Carl hurried to spread out his coat and pile the fragments
of the head upon it. While he was engaged in
that, Dick hoisted a window and allowed the outdoor air
to purify the noxious atmosphere of the room. After
that, Matt, Townsend, Dick and Carl spread their handkerchiefs
upon the floor and gathered up all the scattered
stones.</p>

<p>"You had an idea that idol's head was hollow and
that there was something in it, hadn't you, Matt?"
queried Townsend, as they hunted the floor over for
diamonds.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer. "I dug it out of the first
paragraph written on that piece of parchment. 'Read
and give heed, for the head of Obboney contains many
things, perilous and otherwise.' I got to thinking that
those words might be read in two ways."</p>

<p>"It was a great scheme that," observed Townsend,
"hiding a treasure of diamonds in the head of an idol
which gives off a deadly odor. I wish we knew more
about the Man from Cape Town and where he got the
stones; but he is dead, and the mystery will no doubt
always remain unsolved."</p>

<p>"Unless his daughter can tell us something about her
father," said Matt.</p>

<p>"That is possible, of course. There must be fully
two hundred of these stones, and they are all of the very
finest. A fortune, my lads! Part of it comes to me,
and out of my part we shall share and share alike."</p>

<p>The boys, with the exception of Carl, began to protest,
but Townsend silenced them with a word.</p>

<p>"It is only right," he averred. "You have borne many
dangers on account of that iron chest, and mere justice
calls upon you to have your due share of the treasure.
I shall make it my business to see that you get it."</p>

<p>When the last stone was gathered off the floor, and
the handkerchiefs were all carefully tied up, the little
bundles of stones were turned over to Townsend. He
stowed them carefully away in his pockets.</p>

<p>"The question now arises," said he, "as to what we
shall do with Jurgens, Whistler, Bangs and the unknown?
No doubt we could make them smart for what
they have done, not only here in New Orleans, but also
for Jurgens' and Whistler's criminal work in stealing the
<i>Grampus</i>. But will it pay to bother with them?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night," returned Matt, promptly. "The thing
for you to do, Townsend, is to get safely aboard the
<i>Grampus</i> as quick as you can. You have the price of
a king's ransom about your clothes and it would be foolish
to take any chances with it."</p>

<p>"Like alvays," chirped Carl, "Modor Matt has hit der
nail righdt on der head. Vat he says goes mit me, und
it ought to go mit eferypody else."</p>

<p>"It does," asserted Townsend. "I have lain a prisoner
in that old bank vault for two days, and the inconvenience
and discomfort I have been put to I shall
not soon forget; but Jurgens and Whistler have been
beaten at their own game. Besides, my lads, it was, on
the whole, a good thing that Bangs worked his little
game successfully. If he hadn't, I should have opened
that iron chest in the home of a lady on St. Charles
Avenue, and who knows what the consequences would
have been? Jurgens and Bangs first tested the deadly
effluvia of the idol's head, and we were able to profit
by their experience. Yes, it is best to leave them here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and allow them to recover and go their ways. The
knowledge that they are beaten will be punishment
enough for them."</p>

<p>Having settled the matter in this way, Townsend and
the boys passed the prostrate forms in the other room,
gained the apartment at the head of the stairs, blew out
the candle and went away.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later they were on the levee; and ten
minutes after that they were boarding the <i>Grampus</i> and
slipping down under her decks through the top of the
conning tower.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">DIAMONDS GALORE.</p>


<p>Before Carl climbed downward through the conning
tower of the <i>Grampus</i>, he shook the fragments of the
idol's head out of his coat upon the rounded deck of the
submarine and heard them glide off and splash into the
water.</p>

<p>"Dere vill be some foolishness among der fishes, I bed
you!" he chuckled; "aber, all der same, it vas goot-py to
Obboney! Und may nodding like him efer come oudt
oof Africa again."</p>

<p>Cassidy, mate of the <i>Grampus</i>, was the only one of the
crew aboard. He had had no idea of the perils through
which Townsend had passed, nor of the troubles encountered
by the boys. He knew, of course, that the boys
had arrived, for all up and down the river front the
<i>Hawk</i> was the topic of conversation.</p>

<p>In the conning tower of the <i>Grampus</i>, that evening,
there was a spread. Cassidy opened canned goods and
made coffee on an alcohol stove. The guests at the
"feed" sat around with their tin plates in their laps,
and while they ate they talked over recent exciting
events.</p>

<p>Carl offered information of value by telling how the
iron chest had been stolen from Townsend, placed on
a boat in the river, and had then vanished while Jurgens
and Whistler were dodging the watchmen.</p>

<p>"That boat must have been adrift on the river for
two days!" exclaimed Townsend. "Strange that some
one else did not find the chest instead of you boys."</p>

<p>"I reckon she caught in the eddies below the town and
drifted back and forth until she finally got out in the
current," surmised Dick. "That's the only way you can
account for the fact that she wasn't picked up."</p>

<p>"You vas bot' wrong," asserted Carl, solemnly. "Dere
vas a gaptain on dot rowpoat all der time. It vas Captain
Obboney, in der chest. Nodding could habben py
dot poat mit dot itol's headt apoard."</p>

<p>"There may be something in that," observed Townsend,
half smiling and half serious. "This New Orleans
affair appears to be wrapped up in a great deal of occultism.
Personally, I never took much stock in occultism,
but I don't know how I can dodge the facts developed
by those smoke pictures."</p>

<p>"And then there's a whole lot more to Yamousa than
just those smoke pictures," said Dick. "Whistler went
to see her to find out if she couldn't tell him what had
become of the chest."</p>

<p>"Voodooism used to be quite strong in New Orleans,
among credulous blacks and superstitious whites," said
Townsend. "Of course, there's nothing in voodooism
as it is usually practiced, but this Yamousa seems versed
in many peculiar things. Really, I don't know what to
think of her."</p>

<p>"Well," asserted Carl, "she makes a misdake vonce in
a vile."</p>

<p>"How so, Carl?"</p>

<p>"Vy, she gave Matt a charm vich vasn't no charm ad
all, but a hootoo. I tried it oudt, und I know. Tick,"
and here Carl faced his chum, "dot dried frog don'd
vas any goot as a luck pringer. It got me indo lods oof
drouple. I safed dot from you, bard," and Carl shifted
his gaze to Matt.</p>

<p>"Where is that charm now, Carl?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"Pangs dook it avay from me," chuckled Carl, "und I
bed you someding for nodding dot it made all der drouple
for Pangs, Jurgens und Whistler."</p>

<p>"We might just as well explain it that way as in any
other," said Townsend. "Many things have happened
which defy explanation, so Carl's guess is just as good
as any one's else."</p>

<p>"I can tell you somet'ing vich ain'd a guess," continued
Carl, "und dot iss dot Jurgens hat a feller vatching
Cassidy, und ven Cassidy sent dot delegram to Modor
Matt, Jurgens' man vas aple to findt oudt vat vas in it.
Dot's der vay Pangs habbened to be on der levee ven der
air ship come down on der dock. He knowed dot ve vas
coming."</p>

<p>"Where were you this afternoon, Cassidy?" inquired
Matt.</p>

<p>"I took the <i>Grampus</i> over to Algiers yesterday," answered
the mate, "and didn't get back until about four
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"That's the reason we didn't see you," put in Dick.
"If you had been around the levee Bangs would never
have been able to pull off that game of his."</p>

<p>"I told Cassidy to drop over to Algiers if he thought
best," said Townsend. "It was unlucky that he happened
to be there at just the time he might have been
of service to Matt and his friends. However, as I told
you in the rooms over the antique shop, it's just as well
events turned out as they have. We have won out
against Jurgens and Whistler, and if they know when
they're well off they'll steer clear of all of us in future."</p>

<p>"Dose fellers hat two hang-oudts," remarked Carl.
"Vone vas ad Rigolette's blace, vere der chest vas dook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
from der tock, und der odder vas ofer der antique shop.
Vone, I reckon, vas vere dey dook us in, und der odder
vas vere dey viped us oudt. But der itol's headt fooled
der lod oof us. I vish, py shinks, you couldt haf seen
Jurgens und Pangs ven der chest vas obened und dey
saw nodding more as sawdust!"</p>

<p>Carl threw back his head and laughed till he shook.</p>

<p>"I vasn't in der blace vere I could enchoy dot, at der
time," he went on, "but I can haf fun mit it now. Id
vas a derriple tissapointment. Den, ven Jurgens kicked
der headt oudt oof der sawdust, eferypody vas scart, including
me. Yah, I vas as afraidt as anypody. Den,
pympy, I tropped ashleep und I vasn't affraidt no more."</p>

<p>"You were tied, weren't you, Carl, while you were in
that room at Rigolette's?"</p>

<p>"You bed you I vas, Matt, handt und feet."</p>

<p>"How did you get clear of the ropes?"</p>

<p>"Dot vas some mysderies. I don'd know dot, onless I
vorked meinseluf loose ven I come to und vas grazy.
Anyvay, ven I vas aple to know vere I vas I vas in der
shdreed und dere vasn't any ropes on me. Vat you say
Rigolette call dot monkey?"</p>

<p>"Joujou," replied Dick.</p>

<p>"Den I vas mooch opliged to Chouchou. How t'ings
fall oudt mit demselufs oof you leaf dem alone! Dere
vas me, und Jurgens, und Pangs, lying in dot room mit
der itol's headt, und passing oudt oof der game py

pefore dot, und I oxbect he vas looking for me to gif
it pack. Anyvay, he leafs der hat und goes off mit der
itol's headt, safing me, und dose odder fellers, aber killing
himseluf in der oberations. Yah, Chouchou vas a

<p>"No," said Dick. "Has Rigolette a parrot?"</p>

<p>"Yah, so, und dot barrot make some foolishness mit
me aboudt der time der monkey shdeal my cap. Vell,
anyhow, it vas all ofer now, und I feel dot I can laugh at
some t'ings vich ditn't blease me pefore."</p>

<p>"What will you and your chums do now, Matt?" inquired
Townsend.</p>

<p>"We seem to have wound up our business in New
Orleans in short order," laughed Matt, "so I suppose we
had better bear away for Atlantic City."</p>

<p>"You haven't helped me, yet, in the work for which I
wired you to come on here."</p>

<p>All three of the boys were startled.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it to help you recover that chest?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"Not at all. At the time I requested Cassidy to send
you the telegram, I had the chest safely in my hands
and hadn't the least idea that Jurgens and Whistler
were around and still had designs on it. You got here
in good time to be of invaluable assistance to me, and
fate so played the cards that I couldn't have won out
without you&mdash;but I wanted you for something else."</p>

<p>"In that event," returned Matt, "we'll have to stay
and give you our assistance."</p>

<p>"The <i>Hawk</i> has an excellent berth on the big dock
and will be amply protected in case of high winds or
bad weather; and, so far as I can see, you and your
friends will be as well off as though you were in Atlantic
City. So far as profit is concerned, there will be diamonds
galore for all of you, and by this one trip to
New Orleans you will have cleaned up more than you
could possibly have made in a dozen years at Atlantic
City."</p>

<p>"Tiamonts galore!" caroled the Dutch boy. "Dot
soundts goot. I like tiamonts pedder as anyt'ing else, und
ven you ged a whole lod, all in a punch, it makes you
feel like you vas somepody. I vould like to haf some
oof dem set in pins, und rings, und pud dem all ofer me.
I vant to be a prilliant feller," he grinned, "und I guess
dot's der only vay vat I can be dot."</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning," went on Townsend, "I will
hunt up this lady about whom the Man from Cape Town
told me. Following the division of the gems, I will call
on this Rigolette and, if he has not already released
Bangs, will have him do so. Then, when we have a
clear slate, I will lay before you the business which I
have in prospect."</p>

<p>"Iss it easy?" queried Carl.</p>

<p>"No, very difficult."</p>

<p>"Dot's vat ve like. Anypody can do der easy t'ings,
aber it dakes Modor Matt to do der hard vones."</p>

<p>"Carl has an armful of bouquets, to-night," laughed
Matt, "and he don't care where he throws them."</p>

<p>"Iss id t'rilling vork?" continued Carl.</p>

<p>"Likely to be," smiled Townsend, "and perhaps a bit
dangerous."</p>

<p>"Den be sure und keep id for us. All vat I ask iss,
dot you cut out der foodoos. A leedle oof dose iss more
as enough."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MASKED_LIGHT" id="THE_MASKED_LIGHT">THE MASKED LIGHT.</a></h2>


<p>San José Lighthouse shone from the back of a tunnel-like
creek on a barren stretch of the Chilian seaboard. Passing
ships caught its secret rays most suddenly; much in the
same manner as a lonely wayfarer might be startled at a
swift glance of a light far down a secret entrance.</p>

<p>The moment the light of San José fell upon a ship, that
vessel at once hugged the land and crept warily along the
inshore water. A false order, a mistake at the helm, and
the "Devil's Teeth," the offshore reef, would grind her ribs
to matchwood.</p>

<p>The light was built on top of an old chapel whose ponderous
walls could have carried the Eddystone itself. This
building crouched in the left-hand corner of the creek, with
its back built into the angle of the cliff, which, on that side,
rose plumb as a wall and ran out into deep soundings. There
was, however, one break in it about eighty yards in front
of the lighthouse. From this opening an overhead traveling
cable passed across the creek to the mid-level of "Cassandra
Mine," which honeycombed the right bank.</p>

<p>This latter side, though rocky, was fairly easy of ascent
by means of buttress-like masses of rock jutting out from
the cliff, and the rubbish shot out from the mine.</p>

<p>Such was the lonely creek of San José when the revolution
broke out against President Balmaceda, and left us, Gilbert
and myself, stranded helplessly on a foreign shore.</p>

<p>Nine months before, we had departed from our homes in
the States, appointed engineers to the Cassandra Coppermining
Company, Limited. Nine months before! and now
our situation was worse than any Bowery loafer's; he, at
all events, could try the station house when the nights grew
colder.</p>

<p>"I knew it was too good to last," cried Gilbert, one morning
as we awoke to find ourselves in a dismal plight. The
mine was deserted: every man had gone to shoulder a musket
on the principle of "compulsory volunteering." We transferred
our worries by means of a letter to the head office,
and then fell to unlimited euchre, awaiting instructions.
Meanwhile, our funds melted away.</p>

<p>At last came one day of maddening heat that drove us to
the shade of the mid-level of the mine. There we did what
we ought to have done a month before: we held a council
of war.</p>

<p>"We've just three and a half pesos left&mdash;that's about three
dollars," quoth Gilbert sourly.</p>

<p>"Then we've got to tramp."</p>

<p>"Tramp!" echoed Gilbert, "in <i>that</i>!" and he cast an exasperated
glance at the landscape. It was an open oven.
Below us, the lighthouse lenses flashed back the sunlight in
such brightness that if we had not known that all the lights
on the coast had been extinguished by order, we might have
thought the lamps were still burning. The village huts
seemed to shrink and huddle from the glare. Not a creature
was abroad; the very air seemed to have swooned in the heat
of that narrow creek.</p>

<p>And yet, over the hill crest where the village path cut the
upland, a tiny speck rose to sight, and without a pause descended
the slope toward us.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" gasped my chum, starting up in amazement.
"He's stark, staring mad!"</p>

<p>It was a man running at a sling trot.</p>

<p>"Madman number two," cried Gilbert, and another speck
breasted the crest, and hurriedly descended on the heels of
the first comer. And then, by ones and twos, more men
appeared and swung downward, hurriedly and without a
halt, until we counted twenty-one of them on the slope.
They came nearer and lower, and we saw sparkles of light
breaking off them as they ran; then we both cried together:
"Soldiers!" And at that word all the world was of interest.</p>

<p>By this time they were up to the first huts, and at a cry
every soul rushed outside.</p>

<p>Some of the runners had fallen by the houses, and people
began to carry water to them.</p>

<p>"Poor beggars," cried Gilbert, "but if they <i>will</i> run on a
day like this&mdash;why on earth don't they go inside and rest
peacefully?"</p>

<p>But that was the last thing they gave us any impression of
so doing. We saw Henrico, the old sailor with the earrings
and Spanish handkerchief for a cap, talking among a group
of the soldiers. Now and again they looked back to the
crest, and then toward our side of the creek. Something
of great interest was meanwhile passing from hand to hand.
Suddenly Henrico turned to the villagers, addressing them
in no little heat. The soldiers seized their guns, and then,
led by Henrico, the whole crowd, villagers and soldiers, began
to ascend the talus of the mine. Halfway up, Henrico
turned and called back to the women, "All you in siesta
again." But one of them, Chloe, the sharp-tongued beauty
of the village, broke away, and headed the whole crowd.</p>

<p>Striding along with her buoyant energy, she soon outstripped
them all, and in a few minutes she appeared on the
ledge in front of us, two hundred feet above the creek. For
a moment she stood silent, a swarthy black-eyed beauty, holding
the two plaits of her hair in outstretched hands: just in
the same attitude and with just the same smile on her arched
lips we saw her every morning when she called us to breakfast;
for she was Henrico's niece and we lodged with him.</p>

<p>"Fortune, señors!" cried she. "Here are soldiers with a
message; we do not read in our village; we come to you to
speak it to us." And now the soldiers filed in, and Henrico
proffered me a crumpled paper. I read on it: "To Capitan
Barras." "Here!" cried I, "this is not for us."</p>

<p>"No," said a dusty, sweat-soaked soldier, "Capitan Barras
is killed. I am his sergeant. Read, señor, I am the next."</p>

<p>"I nodded and read on:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The enemy are reënforcing by sea. Have correct information
that they intend capturing the lighthouse at San José<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
on the 12th, and light it to guide the transports which are
due to pass the inshore channel of the Devil's Teeth. Detail
a command to destroy the lighthouse beyond repair. I have
wired to the cruisers; latter will be able to overtake and
capture transports if delayed off San José on the night of the
12th. You have six (6) hours start of the enemy.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Rodrique Gomez.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>As I finished this terse and emphatic message the sergeant
cried "Ho!" and "Is that the lighthouse?"</p>

<p>"Yes," sang out the villagers as one man.</p>

<p>"Advance!" cried the sergeant, shouldering to the front
of the crowd; Chloe was already on her way out, but with
a sharp, smothered cry she stopped dead in the opening,
turned round, and thrust back the following men, hissing
the while through her teeth:</p>

<p>"Silence! not a breath; the enemy!"</p>

<p>There came a sudden metallic rattling, a rapid snapping of
rifle breeches, then dead, nervous silence.</p>

<p>The lighthouse was in possession of the enemy! Already
a couple of soldiers leaned over the balcony round the lenses,
and we could hear their voices as they sang out to a
mounted officer below. About this latter, and standing at
ease, were some eighty men.</p>

<p>"And the videttes," growled the sergeant, as he pointed to
the hill crest. At this an angry murmur arose about us.
They were completely outnumbered by the Balmacedians;
and outmaneuvred by the fatal mischance to their captain
in a skirmish at daybreak. He had been shot through the
throat. With a last effort he had thrust the note into the
sergeant's hands and bade him haste to San José, halting
neither to fight nor to rest. This we learned afterward.</p>

<p>From the first appearance of the soldiers in the mine,
Gilbert had been eying them with undisguised irritation. He
now called out in a sharp voice for their attention.</p>

<p>"If you stay here those other soldiers will attack you and
'gastado' the whole set of you. And this mine being American
property and not a battle field, the best you can do is to
clear out by the level on the far side before they discover
you."</p>

<p>At this the sergeant looked blankly in his face.</p>

<p>"It's no good," quoth Gilbert, "you must clear out."</p>

<p>The sergeant's face changed. He slapped the breech of his
rifle, swore a round oath, and cried heartily: "This place
is our last stand; I shoot the first of my men that leaves!"</p>

<p>Gilbert dropped his eyelids in his tired way, and pulled out
his watch.</p>

<p>"I give you five minutes," he said, in a level, matter-of-fact
voice.</p>

<p>"And we," cried the sergeant, "have to destroy that
lighthouse!"</p>

<p>Here Chloe thrust herself into the front of the gathering
storm.</p>

<p>"The soldier has it," she cried, "the lighthouse must be destroyed.
You, señors, engineer chiefs will show us the way;
it will be done."</p>

<p>"I'll see you all hanged first," broke in Gilbert in terse
English. Then he added in Spanish: "Clear out! only another
two minutes." Chloe lifted her head in a passion, and
her black eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"Señors," she cried with scorn, "have we idled in the
fetching of water when water was so scarce, for the big
'tub' every morn? and you have had meat and your coffee
roasted to the hour. All; and not one pesos these months.
Have we cried 'clear out' to you when you could not no
more than these soldiers?"</p>

<p>Gilbert thrust his watch back in his shirt. We both flushed
hotly, and we both found it disconcerting to look in one another's
faces. But it had to be done.</p>

<p>"That's a bitter pill to swallow," growled he.</p>

<p>"It's true enough," I said.</p>

<p>Gilbert, with a short, grim laugh in his throat, growled
out, "Well, let us begin to earn our grub."</p>

<p>Chloe read our decision in our faces. "Huzza," she cried,
"the engineer chiefs&mdash;capitanos&mdash;will show us how to destroy
it. We are the legs, the arms; they are the head. The
lighthouse shall not be there to-night!"</p>

<p>In this manner Gilbert and I became "capitanos" in the
Revolutionary army. From an inert and baffling position we
were lifted on a wave, and flung into a rushing current.
There was work for our hands and brains: a problem to
solve, a thing to accomplish. And we were no longer weary.</p>

<p>Henrico and the sergeant joined us in a short council of
war. And as at any moment the enemy's scouts might blunder
on us and bring on a fight, we decided to retreat to a
lower level, where we could hold an army corps at bay. Safe
in this, Gilbert and I sat apart; the soldiers scooped out
resting places, and, with their knapsacks for pillows, fell
instantly asleep.</p>

<p>"Confound that girl," said Gilbert, "and confound the
whole place and their tin-pot armies too! But it is a fine
problem, eh? I suppose the only way to do it is by&mdash;well,
anything else but fighting."</p>

<p>I quite agreed with him. But as hour after hour passed,
and scheme after scheme was rejected, we began to think a
little less of our abilities. We wrestled with the problem
till our heads reeled. If only we could get a side glance even
at a workable scheme. But no. At last Gilbert pulled out his
Waterbury. "Five o'clock!" he cried, "we are undiluted
frauds if we can't do it in another hour. It will be dark by
six!"</p>

<p>Chloe had, in the meantime, crawled out by another level
to report what was doing in the creek. She had just come
back. The enemy were bivouacked round the lighthouse.
On the upland, and commanding every approach, sentries
and videttes marked the land as far as she could see.</p>

<p>However, she had brought one piece of comfort in the
shape of a cool jar of water. As she served us she asked
for news of our scheme.</p>

<p>"How soon do the hands and legs begin to work, capitanos?"
she asked with a complacent smile. Gilbert, with a
diplomatic, Spanish-fashion wave of his hand, replied: "So!
so!"</p>

<p>"Ah, señors," said she, "I should want to do it&mdash;how?
Why, shut up that lighthouse like flinging a blanket over it:
so!"</p>

<p>"And," cried Gilbert, "that's just what we are going to
do! Tell the men to be ready on the instant." As she departed
he turned to me with dancing eyes.</p>

<p>"See?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"No; not an atom."</p>

<p>"No? Well, old man, she has struck the only plan possible!
Observe the overhead traveling wire. It lands on
the flat just outside the other opening, doesn't it? Well,
suppose we hang a curtain&mdash;even Chloe's skirt, if it were
big enough&mdash;on that wire, and run it out, and cut off the
light from flashing out to seaward."</p>

<p>"But," I objected, "we can't make a screen big enough
to intercept all the light at a hundred feet distance&mdash;it is
impracticable."</p>

<p>He laughed in my face, and cried out:</p>

<p>"My boy, rays of light from lighthouses are <i>parallel</i>!"</p>

<p>I had forgotten this elementary fact. I cried "Eureka!"
and then we faced our task: a race against time.</p>

<p>The men streamed up to us, heard, and set to work immediately.
We requisitioned the tarpaulin covers from the
bags of cement; even emptied the bags themselves. We
stripped hundreds of yards of telephone wires in the galleries.
We descended to a still lower level; we were all
tailors, sailmakers, anything, everything. Some patched
holes, while others sewed cover to cover until a sheet, fifty
feet square, grew beneath our hands, sewn together with
wire, and impervious to a single ray of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>As the last hole was stilettoed with the point of a bayonet,
Gilbert and I sought the upper level. We found the night
had fallen. The cold sea breeze tasted like nectar after the
candle-burnt atmosphere in the workshop below. Our eyes
sought the lighthouse; a couple of men were in the lantern;
one held a candle, and was clumsily striving to light the
argand burners.</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Gilbert, "they'll smash some glasses, or
I'm an idiot. Now for the launch!"</p>

<p>We descended to our workshop. The flushed, wet faces
of the screen makers confronted us, and Gilbert spoke.</p>

<p>"We want a volunteer to cross to the other side and clear
the wire, and to signal back when ready for us to haul out
the screen. It must be one of you from the village, one who
knows every stone in the darkness. And one who is not
afraid. Who volunteers?"</p>

<p>There was a silence in which we heard the water dripping
in far-deep levels. Gilbert looked from face to face;
in vain, it seemed. The villagers were, however, weighing
the risk of failure. Chloe stepped quietly from the group,
and as quietly said: "This is a woman's business; is it not
so, Uncle Henrico? Who knows so well as I the rock paths
through the lines of the sentinels? And if I meet them&mdash;well,
I am a woman and I laugh. If I were a man&mdash;well,
the end of me and our venture."</p>

<p>"'Tis true," growled Henrico, "Chloe must go."</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken before she had given a swift wave
of her hand to us, and vanished up the adit.</p>

<p>We followed, dragging our great screen, and presently
we peered out into the night. In that little time they had
managed to get some at least of the lamps to burn, and now
we saw a glowing circle of light. Henrico, Gilbert, and
myself alone crept on to the ledge outside. Everything had
to be done by touch. Henrico had been a sailor, and to him
fell the delicate task of hooking the screen on to the traveling
wire. Foot by foot it disappeared overhead, and presently
Henrico swarmed back to us and we crept together,
and laid our ears on the wire cable. It sang and hummed in
the night wind like a harp string. Little jars and metallic
jingles broke the even rise and fall of sound. Was it
Chloe? Should we hear the signal clear or confused, loud
or soft? On a sudden our doubts were settled. Our ears
rang as a clear sharp blow quivered on the wire.</p>

<p>"Safe," we cried in delight, and soon after that came the
arranged three clear blows across the wire.</p>

<p>In another second we were all heaving hard and fast at
the traveler overhead. Foot by foot it crept along, until
we saw, with breathless delight, a huge blackness slicing
into the circle of light. An unforetold eclipse! It intersected
it completely. Not a ray escaped seaward.</p>

<p>So far we had won.</p>

<p>Dripping with sweat, and nigh breathless, we dropped to
the rock and looked toward the lighthouse. The lantern
seemed to be utterly deserted. Against the lower windows
of the chapel we could see the silhouettes of the guard.
They were playing cards. Not an eye had seen our operations.
As we rejoined the sergeant, Gilbert chuckled and
said: "The game is ours! Joker, right bower, and left!"</p>

<p>"Not yet," quoth Henrico grimly, "the fight is at the
dawn."</p>

<p>"Across there," added the soldier, nodding his head toward
the other landing place of the wire.</p>

<p>We had much yet to learn of the ups and downs of war;
and more, too, to learn about our mine. For we now found
every villager busily polishing up a rifle; and soon, too, they
were dragging up half a dozen cases of ammunition from
secret places in the far levels. And we were the engineers
of this same mine!</p>

<p>Henrico served round the ammunition. The sergeant inspected
every new rifle. He handed one to each of us in
such an ordinary way of routine, that we accepted them and
fell immediately into line to wait the coming of events. Two
hours later, the tide had fallen sufficiently to enable a crossing
to be made outside the mine.</p>

<p>Fifteen men were to guard the other landing place of the
wire.</p>

<p>They passed out in single file, five soldiers and ten villagers,
the sergeant in command. He carried two rifles.
"One for our 'advance guard,' Chloe," he said, with a laugh
wrinkling his brown face as he passed us. The next instant
he stepped through the opening. And so he passed from
our life: a little, sinewy man, of few words, but of most
prompt decision; following his trade cheerfully, and uncomplaining
if in the day's march bad tools or adverse luck
befell him. He died across there in the dawn; perhaps he
saw the sun rise, and knew the end of the night's work; I
hoped so.</p>

<p>It was now close upon ten o'clock, and there were about
seven hours for us to keep most vigilant and secret watch
upon the lighthouse. From time to time we saw a man
enter the lantern and trim the lamps. Once he stepped out
on the balcony, and, leaning over the rail, quietly smoked
his cigarette.</p>

<p>Gilbert clutched my arm like a vise. "If that man moves
to the other side we are done! He will see his shadow on
the screen!"</p>

<p>But, to our infinite joy, he passed in and down to join
his comrades. Below, in the chapel, they played cards,
changed sentries, and slept; all in complete unconsciousness
of the ill trick we had played them.</p>

<p>Night was waning. Henrico pointed to a paler shadow
on the crest above the creek. The wind had dropped; the
air was filled with the sound of the tide seething in the
rocks and weeds below us. Save that, all was still. Everything
seemed to be watching and waiting.</p>

<p>Presently we could see one another's hands and faces.
Henrico at once mustered all the defenders and posted them
among the serried rocks on the talus.</p>

<p>It was an ambuscade in an amphitheatre. Some one
dropped a musket, and, at the sound, we all glanced nervously
at the lighthouse; no one stirred within, and we were
crouching down&mdash;when a most horrid crash and volleying of
shots broke out across the creek.</p>

<p>"On guard!" cried Henrico; "the patrol has found our
outpost."</p>

<p>Even while he spoke, and even above the din, we caught
the ring of quick hoarse cries of command from the lighthouse.
The door was flung open and a stream of soldiers
sallied forth&mdash;to instant death. From every stone of our
ambuscade, spitting flashes converged on the open door.
It was a butchery at such a point-blank range, and with a
light behind to show the mark. The crash of our volley died
away as swiftly as it commenced. For a moment I thought
that not a man had escaped uninjured. Nothing but a
tumbled, dark heap filled the doorway and the little circle
of light. But, suddenly, from the shelter of the interior,
some one struck down the candle inside with the butt end of
a musket, and the darkness swallowed all up, for it was as
night yet down there.</p>

<p>Then we became aware of the hushed silence that was
about us. Not a shot resounded from the direction of our
outpost. Had the attack failed or had they captured our
post? Involuntarily I glanced at our screen. It was still
there, now just dimly outlined on the paling sky. Gilbert
called softly to Henrico to know what he thought of the
silence at the other side. We saw Henrico craning over his
rock, and striving to pierce the blackness at the foot of the
creek; his hand was up to keep silent. At last, out of the
vagueness of empty sounds, we caught a faint patter of
footsteps, and, as we heard it, it came nearer and nearer:
men running in desperate haste. In a trice they were below
us in the shadows. Some one cried "Up here"; another
called to Henrico: "They have left the post," and all in
the same breath we were fighting for our lives!</p>

<p>The boys who want to learn something from what they read, as
well as to be interested by it, will never find another publication
that will satisfy them so well as MOTOR STORIES. "Motor
Matt" is not an impossible boy character. He is simply a youth who
has had considerable training in a machine shop where motors of all
kinds were repaired, and who is possessed of a genius for mechanics.
His sense of right and wrong is strongly developed, and his endeavors
to insure certain people a square deal, lead him into a series of the
most astonishing, but at the same time the most natural adventures
that ever befell a boy.</p>
